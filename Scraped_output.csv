                Hello, i'm a 24yo male. It would be very helpful if someone read this and shared their thoughts :)

4 years ago I got a very nasty flu-like illness. It passed after 10 days but some symptoms remained: body aches, fatigue, itching and tingling, nausea, feelings of heat and pressure under left armpit and pain around the neck/shoulders area after drinking alcohol. Every 3 months each year I would get the same flu-like symptoms for about a week. All other symptoms would get worse with them but would then slowly decline until the next episode. Almost all my blood work has been normal. When something is off (high CRP just once), it is back to normal in a month. Imaging tests (chest X-rays and head MRIs) have also all been normal. So neurological problems, autoimmune problems and infections have been reliably eliminated as possible causes.

Then symptoms have somewhat changed. I have had only two flu-like attacks this winter, the second being very mild. Most symptoms have gone away. The fatigue and the itching (in the palms and soles) remain and I have been having night sweats for a year now. I am not more tired and don't feel generally worse and the pain after consuming alcohol is gone or much milder.

3 and a half years after the symptoms started I found a small lymph node in my neck. There were none before; I checked, doctors checked, and I have had a CT scan of the entire upper half looking for them and a neck ultrasound.

Recent ultrasounds showed that I have many lymph nodes in my neck, but none in my chest or abdomen. They have not checked my groin where I have been having some weird feelings like those under my armpit (no nodes found there either) and in my neck. The nodes in my neck are all small (less than 1 cm in all dimensions) and look normal according to the doctors. So they are not giving me a biopsy.

At this points, almost everything else has been eliminated as cause, except maybe some rare conditions. Since I do not seem to be getting worse generally speaking (not more tired, have not lost weight, no fever, blood work all good of late) doctors thought before the lymph nodes that i should just ""live with it"". 

So I guess my question is, can lymphoma/hodgkins evolve this slowly and cause symptoms years before any nodes are there ? Should I insist I get a biopsy ? Is a biopsy even possible with very small nodes (smallest dimension is 2mm for most of them) ? 

Thank you!

                im a 23 year old male. about 5 months ago i had a pretty sever case of laryngitis and got on anti biotics to clear it. it worked however shortly after stopping the anti biotics my lymph nodes on the left side of my neck swelled. they were not painful even at first, they are only about the size of a pea to a bean. i must emphasize they were not there prior to the illness as im very body conscious and i also have none of them on the right side. my doctor agreed it was odd so ordered a chest x ray, that showed very minor fluid so they did a Ct scan which was clear (the fluid was from my body fighting off the remnant of the infection they assumed since it was gone) after this i was told to wait a few weeks and the nodes should shrink however they didnt, my doctor then checked me for mono, Tb, HiV AND EVERYTHING under the sun in my blood work, the only oddity was my B12 was very minutely low which was assumed because i had hardly been eating. The doctor then ordered an ultrasound of the nodes, it showed nothing out of the ordinary besides stating they were slightly enlarged with the largest being just under a centimeter and i had a 5mm cyst on my thyroid. I was sent to a thyroid specialist who was unconcerned about that. I also seen an ENT who said my nodes didnt worry him at all however he abd my doctor disagree on them going away; my PcP said my nodes are most likely 'scarred' or nodes that respond to infection and dont ever return to normal size while the ENT said they probably will go down someday.
my concern is if they missed something, I know the nodes arent big but there are 5-7 of them in my neck that size asymetrically just on one side. they have been there for 4 months now (nearly 5) with no change and i have read about slow growing lymphomas like Hodgkins etc that can take years to fully manifest. i really want a biopsy but they all say my nodes dont 'meet the criteria' but i know that ultrasound is not the definitive test here. Has anyone else had nodes that never quiet returned to normal size? several doctors seem sure they are of no concern but since none can explain them, or even agree if i should expect them to stay, should i be concerned?

                Hi. I’m a 48 year old male. Had pain in throat and jaw bone for a year off and on. The pain also goes under my arms and in my chest and upper back. I cannot find any swollen nodes except on jaw bone I think I feel a little something but not sure.  I feel horrible. Fatigue and the pains and sometimes short of breath and no energy. I went to ent  and they looked down my throat and ordered a ct with dye of neck. They didn’t find anything. I went to my md six months ago and he ordered a ct with no dye form my chest and xrays and sono of my neck also was done leading up to all these tests. They find nothing. Well 6 months later I feel horrible. Pain in neck and under arms and chest and upper back. And the thing on my jaw bone. I also went to dentist to rule out that. I’m very tired and very worried it’s lymphoma. I am waiting on blood work as of now. I just think it’s lymphoma from this thing on my jaw line. I don’t even know if the ct scan looked that high up on my jaw line.  The fatigue is the worst. The pains in arms and upper back are not muscle pains. They are just weird pains that come and go. I was examined and they say they can’t feel any swollen nodes. Please help. What tests should I ask for or what could be going on.  Thx

I'm also on methotrexate.  I've had a axillary (armpit) lump for 2 months. Non painful, but I've noticed my shoulder is starting to hurt.  I'm always tired..like can't make it 3 more more hrs without a rest. I used to be a runner. I've lost 25% of my body weight in 3 months. Went to Dr. He put me on Cephalexin for 10 days. No change. In fact, my flank in that area is now larger. They performed an ultrasound last week. It came back as benign lymph node 1.7x1.4x.8 cm. He stated it ""Requires no further follow up"". I asked fo RC th ed report..he typed up a narrative to me as I just gave to you...size, benign and no further fu necessary...  I should mention I also have a mutated STK11 gene.

                my father was in hospice and yes his health was failing and he was dying  on his nursing home bed but my questiion is , it is strange that right when the hospice nurse came to give my dad his morphine shot about two minutes later he died, now you ask, did i want to see him continue to die,? no and if he was suffering i dont know, the night before he was fine, granted his health was getting worse and worse, the fine line these days is would you want to see him suffer any longer or end his misery , well most would think it is ok to assist a person to not suffer, i believe i dont have nor does anyone have that power to take or assist one in his deathl. ONLY God does. so my question is , in hospice, is this what they do? do they assist medically by giving overdose of morphine to patients they think are dying anyway? I am so mad that i just recieved his prescription drug statement and i see that the facility ordered morphone sul sol 20 mgs /MI qty 15 , a five day supply filled 15  dont know if that is what they gave him at once because all i know is that the night before he was fine and that morning i was there with him when they called me to come that he was unresponsive and when i opened his eyes he was not seeing, he was strugling to breathe but he heard me tell him i loved him he told me love back and also to my mom, so what i am getting at is all morning long nothing was administered to him but after about an hour of him struggling to breath the hospice doctor said we are going to give him morphine, right away i thought "" why""  the only logical reasoning i dont beleive in was so they can let him go easily but my belief is NOONE HAS THAT RIGHT TO ASSIST MEDICALLY OR OTHERWISE , ONLY GOD CAN STOP SOMEONES HEART  TO TAKE THEM . THEN AGAIN I AM THINKING LOGICALLY HE WAS ALREADY DYING, AND AS MUCH AS I DONT WANT THIS, I DIDNT WANT TO SEE HIM STRUGGLE ANY LONGER, BUT EITHER WAY I DIDNT KNOW IF HE WAS DYING NATURALLY BUT I TRUELY BELIEVE THAT GOD SAW WHAT WAS GOING ON AND EVEN THOUGH HE WAS READY TO TAKE HIM, THE MORPHINE JUST ACCELLERATED THE EASING OUT OF THIS LIFE FOR HIM ACCORDING TO THE DOCTORS. I AM SO SAD, BUT I ALSO DIDINT WANT HIM TO SUFFER ANY LONGER, HE WAS STRUGGLING TO BREATHE FOR TWO HOURS, BUT I KNOW THAT GOD ALLOWED HIM TO TELL US HE LOVED US ONE LAST TIME, AND HE DID, EVEN THOUGH THE HOSPICE DOCTOR SAID IT WAS MEDICALLY IMPOSSIBLE TO DO SO, WELL THAT IS THE POWER OF GOD WE THAT BELIEVE KNOW EXISTS AND OTHERS DONT, AT LEAST HE TOLD US HE LOVED US BEFORE HE TOOK HIS LAST BREATH... WHAT I WANT TO KNOW IS READING THIS, WAS THAT AN ASSISTED DEATH OF SOME TYPE ON THE HOSPICE DECISION,  I SAW THAT THE LEATHEL DOSE IS SIXTY MGS BUT HE WAS FRAIL AND WEAK AND ABOUT 150 POUNDS. WOULD THAT OF PUT HIM DOWN WITHIN A MINUTE AS I SAW IT DID RIGHT AFTER THEY GAVE IT TO HIM?  HE IS GONE NOW AND IT WAS HIS TIME, I KNOW THAT GOD OPENED HIS ARMS AND TOOK HIM KNOWING WHAT WAS GONIG ON AND HE DIDNT WANT HIM TO SUFFER ANY LONGER, AND HE ALLOWED HIM TO TELL US HE LOVED US.... WE ALL HEARD IT...

                Hi, I've been having an enlarged lymphnode in my neck for about almost 2 years now. I've been to the doctor several test have been done with everything coming up “negative"" for cancer, but the enlarged lymphnode is still there and it hurts from time to time. First, on January 8th, 2018 the doctor did a SOFT TISSUE ULTRASOUND and it showed a Sonography right submandibular prominent node measuring 1.6 x 1 x 1.5 cm with prominent blood flow involving the entire lymphnode. The medulla of the lymphnode is effaced and the cortex is thickened, at list 5 mm thickness. So in January 29th, 2028 he suggested a CT Neck Intravenous contrast for further evaluation. And that came with the next results: Limphnodes: Prominent to borderline enlarged bilateral level 2 lymph nodes each meassuring 1.0 cm short axis. At the level of the hyoid bone, there is a enlarged right cervical lymph node associated with the carotid sheath measuring approximate 1.0 cm short axis. At the level of the right thyroid lobe there is a enlarged lymph node measuring 1.2 cm short axis. There is an enlarged right submandibular lymphnode measuring 1.1 cm short axis by 1.7 cm in AP dimension. The conclusion of this CT test is: Multifocal prominent to enlarged cervical lymph nodes, right greater than left. Largest lymph node is seen within the right submandibular region measures 1.1 x 1.7 cm in cross-section. Given this results, the Dr. referred me in February 2018 to do a FINE NEEDLE BIOPSY of the right submandibular lymph node, level 1B.  The final diagnosis of this was: No metastatic epithelioid infiltrates, granulomata, or Reed-Sternberg-type cells seen. Current flow cytometric analysis performed and reported to show no flow immunophenotypic evidence for a lymphoproliferative disorder. So after all of this the doctor told me there is not showing of cancer. Which is a positive results. Then in September 9th, 2018 the doctor proceeded to make lab work for some viruses and it came positive for the Epstein-Barr Virus IgM Antibody with 153.00 u/mL range. He also checked for Lyme Disease which came negative with <0.90 Index. And he also did the Thyroid Screen and it came negative with 0.717 mIU/L range. Given all this tests and results, could it be the Epstein-Barr Virus that is causing the enlarged lymphnodes or could it be something else?

                Hello, Can you help me please... I am so sad and desperate. I am a 10 yr breast cancer survivor (DCIS/LCIS) no spread. no chemo/no radiation just tamoxifen for 5 yrs. Double mastectomy with silicone implants.Last month I felt a lump adjacent to my implant / lower armpit. Dr. checked and said it was either a lymph node or cyst. From there ended up with US/ which found 4 enlarged nodes under arm pit. A fine needle biopsy was done and a body ct scan. Findings on CT scan multiple enlarged nodes under both arms/groin/neck and some abdomen. Needle biopsy (3 samples taken) showed atypical lymphoid hyperplasia. suspicious for non hodgkins lymphoma, but recommend to remove whole node to get an inoperative consultation with a pathologist to establish the diagnosis. The whole node was removed and this is what the report reads: Flow cytometry report. Diagnosis -Involvement by a CD5+ B-cell lymphoproliferative disorder, kappa restricted with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)/small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL) phenotype (see comment).. under comment it says correlation with biopsy findings is advised.  FLOW INTERPRETATION: Overall speciman viability is 50% the lymphocyte gate accounts for 99% of total . B-cells account for 80% of the lymphocyte gate. Accounting for 92% of these cells is immunophenotypically abnormal CD19+, CD20+(dim), CD79b+(dim), CD5+,CD10-,CD23+, CD200+(Bright), CD11c, CD25-/+,CD103-,CD123-,CD305+/-,CD27+,CD38-, IgM-,Kappa surface light chain restricted population of cells, including a minor subset with increased light scatter properties. T-cells account for 16% of the lymphocyte gate (CD4:CD8 ratio = 1.7:1) The expression of CD2, CD5, CD7, CD10, CD25, CD56, CD57 and CD 279 show no diagnostic abnormalities. NK-cells account for <1% of the lymphocyte gate and show no immunophenotypic abnormalities. Pre Interpretation data: cells were stained with a 3-tube panel to assess for involvement y a lymphoprofilerative disorder. The diagnositc panel included the following combinations of fluorochrome-conjugated primpary antibodies: Tube B1 (CD45, CD14, CD19, CD20, CD79b, CD3, CD5, CD10, CD27, CD38, IgM, kappa lambda) Tube B2 (CD45, CD14, CD19, CD3, CD5, CD23, CD200, CD11c, CD25, CD103, CD305, CD123, CD30)
Tube T (CD45, CD14, CD2, CD3, CD5, CD7, CD4, CD8, CD56, CD57, CD45RA, CD45RO, CD279) Data were acquired on a BD LSRForesta flow cytometer and analyzed with FACSDiva software using a CD45/side scatter gating strategy to identify lymphoid lineage cells. Clinical history: multiple enlarge lymph nodes (FNA supsicous for NHL by report.
I have always had lots of inflammation, my white blood count was always slightly high but not by much. There are issues with my implants and my family gp thinks this might be a result of my body rejecting the silicone implants and feels that if they are removed the problem might resolve itself. I am awaiting now to see my oncologist again. I am so confused and sad... does this report mean this is exactly what I have? or does it mean its a possibility but not for certain... could this all be inflammation. Any help or info you could provide would be so appreciated right now as Im not sure what to make of all of this. 
Kindest regards.  
Thank you and god bless.

                I am 22 years old and In October I found 2 pea sized moveable lumps next to eachother on my neck, they are still there after 5 months but have both shrunk a lot. I have now discovered that i have another one in my groin which is around 1cm. Movable and painless. I went to the doctors before finding the groin lump and was  referred for a non urgent ultrasound and the doctor said she isn’t worried. I am going back in 2 days for the groin lump. Back in mid August I had campylobacter then 3-4 weeks later I had the stomach flu. Then found the lumps in October, could it have been caused by that and they have not gone down? I am so terrified and it’s stopping me sleeping at night because I keep thinking it’s something bad. I have no other symptoms and feel completely fine. Does this sound worrying? Any advice is helpful please

                Hello,

I'm a 32 year old woman and since April of 2018, I have been feeling extremely ill with a slew of symptoms that are not normal for me personally. Also, I never know if the symptoms I'm describing are all related, but since they are not normal for me and they all started at the same time (almost overnight) I usually mention them.

My first symptoms were swollen lymph nodes on the back of my neck which subsided about 2 months after first coming on, a swollen lymph node on the right side of my neck behind my ear that grew overnight and has stayed hard, fixed, and swollen since April, difficulty breathing (a painful feeling, like when you breath in very cold air) especially on exertion although I was extremely active and fit when the symptoms started, painful joints, face/hand/knee rashes, extreme fatigue and weakness (often cannot walk up stairs, cannot hold things for more than 10 seconds, cannot carry on a conversation for more than a few minutes without feeling exhausted, etc.), lesions in my nose and on scalp, itchiness which feels deep and ""un-itchable""(if that makes sense!), restless legs, drooping of right eyelid and side of mouth. One of my most troublesome symptoms is severe, painful stomach aches upon eating or drinking anything, even water. The pain in high up, right below my sternum, and feels like my stomach is full of food, even after waking up and not having eaten for 10 hours. I also had low vitamin D (14ng/mL ref. 30-100ng/mL) and hypochromic, microcytic anemia when my blood was first tested. Both of which I was put on a supplement for, but have not felt any better with these supplements. I also went on antibiotics but did not feel better.

This might not be related, but I went to an oral surgeon in December and was told I have stage V TMJ derangement (severe joint deformity with degenerative condylar changes). The oral surgeon said he thought it was from an underlying autoimmune condition or degenerative disease).

In the past two months (since December 2018), I have been having really intense night sweats, a lower back discomfort that is not quite painful but instead a deep ache that won't get better with stretching, heat, massage, etc. and that is much worse at night/when lying down. and have experienced such worsening fatigue to the extent that I often miss work and have missed over two weeks combined since December. My PCP referred me to an ENT to have a lymph node biopsy a few weeks ago (he specifically mentioned Lymphoma), but the ENT said that because my lymph node was only 9mm, she would not biopsy because there would literally be nothing that would show up because it's not active. I had read a little about the sizes of lymph nodes in prep for a possible biopsy and had seen that it might be useful in some cases to biopsy if the lymph node is under 1cm? Also, I feel like for months and months the lymph node has been much bigger, sometimes people comment how they can see it. 

I have been tested for a bunch of autoimmune diseases, as that was what it was first thought to be, but none came back as being positive (Lupus, RA, Scleroderma, Celiac, IBD, Thyroid Disease, Myasthenia Gravis), as well as negative for Lyme Disease, Mono, HIV, EBV, etc.

I have had some abnormalities in my blood in addition to the nutrient deficiencies, including very low ANA (1.27, 1:80), elevated ESR and CRP, elevated platelets. 

My real question is...does it seem like I should press for a biopsy or some kind of imaging of my lymph node or of my back or anything? I definitely trust that the doctors I've seen know what they're doing, but I just feel so incredibly ill that my main concern is I will be unable to work soon and not have insurance for tests or treatment and so am trying to get to the bottom of it before this happens. My PCP didn't seem concerned that the ENT didn't want to biopsy and just wants to ""wait and see"" how I feel, but I don't feel like I have time to wait, as each day I feel sicker and less able to go to work, doctor's appointments (let alone do literally anything I used to enjoy doing!).

Thank you so, so much for reading through this and for any advice you might be able to offer.

                I had Lyme disease in 2012 since then I’ve had chronic swollen lymph nodes in my neck. They usually grow and shrink but 2 of them never get smaller than 1.5 cm. I’ve had an ENT do a FNA biopsy which didn’t show anything and multiple ultrasounds. I have lost my fatty hilum on 2 of the nodes and they are oval shaped and very mobile. Could it possibly be lymphoma after all of these years? My ent is leaning more towards some type of autoimmune disease. I have an enlarged thyroid as well with nodules. I’m scared to go under for a biopsy because I have heart problems. I don’t want to risk my life for a biopsy if it’s probably not lymphoma. I’ve had these swollen lymph nodes for 6 years and they range from 1.5 cm to 4 cm depending on if I’ have some type of infection going on. I’m only 25 and I’m scared that I have cancer and it’s spread. I heard slow growing lymphoma can take 10-15 years to spread. Should I just go ahead with the surgery and risk my life or not worry about it? The lymph nodes are only tender when I’m sick, otherwise I don’t feel them at all unless I put my fingers on it and move it around.

In June my 5 year old had a pea sized lump behind her ear but at the time she was having seizures due to a new Epilepsy diagnosis so it was brushed under the carpet and the lump eventually disappeared. In September My 5 year old had a blood test in hospital in September where her Lymphocytes were quite low 0.65 - they said likely to be caused by a virus.  Yesterday we have just had a abdominal ultra sound and it revealed right iliac foss lymph nodes - most likely caused by Mesenteric Adenitis - in otherwords a virus/infection. The doctors are all pointing towards virus related issues (she gets a virus every 4-6 weeks without fail) or lactose intolerance - just doesnt sit right with me......thoughts? Thank you.

                Hello! My 19 year old daughter has had some swollen and very painful lymph nodes pop up on her head and neck this week. I think 6 maybe. And a very small one in her groin area that is sore as well. She has always had prominent lymph nodes ever since she was little and I’d take her to her pediatrician, they would do blood work, it always came back normal and the nodes would go back down in a week or so with no treatment. So, I took her to her GP on Wednesday of this week. Her dr didn’t seemed too concerned, no fever, just tired. They wrote her a prescription for an antibiotic (zpack), took blood and sent us home. Her blood work came back completely normal. She has one antibiotic left to take but her nodes are still sore and swollen. The one in her groin seems to be going away. I decided to make her an appt with an ENT. They got her in at ENT yearerday (Friday). The ent did a pretty thorough examination, asked a lot of questions. He mentioned lymphoma as a possible cause but said it was unlikely. He ordered some more blood work and a chest X-ray.  He’s testing for Toxoplasmosis, Cat Scrarch Fever, HIV, TB, Angiotensin-Coverting Enzyme (I have no idea what that one is). My daughter has recently gotten a new kitten from an animal shelter and she does have a few scratches on her but I’m not exactly concerned that this is the cause for her swollen and painful lymph nodes. She is also getting over a cold that she contracted about 3 weeks and still had a cough and mucus left over. My daughter also had a full blood work back in April and all was normal then. I guess my question is do you think the chances of this being Lyphoma are high. And why or why not?  She’s been pretty healthy her whole life. And they are also testing for mono. Thank you in advance.

                I've had a small palpable swollen supraclavicular node on the left side for a year now. It sometimes gets inflamed, with visible swelling over the supraclavicular fossa area. I initially had an ultrasound, which the doctors believed appeared normal -- it was under half a centimeter in size, with a normal shape, and visible fat hilum. At the time I was in my last semester of nursing school and had a decent amount of knowledge regarding the disease process, so after reading through hours of lymphoma, nodal drainage, and metastasis related research -- I thought further testing was indicated.

Unfortunately my doctors didn't agree, saying my age/symptoms/US results did't fit the criteria for further referral and told me to come back in 3-4 months for a follow up US. A couple of months later the node was still palpable, so while on vacation in Thailand I decided to take advantage of the access to affordable healthcare, and sought out a second opinion. When I explained my history, and because of the length of time, the doctor was really concerned about potential malignancy deciding it best to have a CT w/ contrast performed with a possible biopsy following... if the results came back abnormal. (I had the CT, US, and blood test done within three hours of first arriving and getting final results) Although very scared, it was refreshing to feel like someone was finally considering my livelihood as seriously as I do.

The CT showed, ""multiple lymph nodes along bilateral submental, internal jugular, and posterior triangle.. size 0.3-0.6cm. No gross mass seen, minimal fibrosis in bilateral apical lungs”.

Although ‘no definite focal mass was noted’ limitation of the study was mentioned by the doctor because of a beam from one of my dental fillings had creating artifact on the scan, and I guess obscured the total view. Regardless, at the time I felt confident with the results, and was glad to continue the trip with it off my shoulders.

Fast forward to… right now. Over a year later, and it's still here. My anxiety is out of control. I spend all of my nights off reading article after article, re-diagnosing myself after each one.

As far as classic symptoms go, I don't have any night sweating, and have gained weight, not lost. My scalp has been super dry and flakey lately, which never happens, and my hair is shedding way more than normal, which can be pretty itchy. This is the only “itch” type symptom though, and I attribute this mainly to stress, but could be wrong. My extremities are often cold to touch, and my feet can sometimes tingle or feel numb — mainly in my big toe. My body seems more and more tense and achy all time, with subtle joint paint, muscle twitching (a recent twitch just started in my right eye). I have had new onset of heart palpitations, which started maybe a month ago, amd though seldom, still pretty scary. As far as fatigue, I feel like I've been perpetually tired since the start of nursing school up until now. Finding a normal sleeping pattern while working nights can be pretty difficult.

Really, I could go on with the details for days, but will spare anyone who’s reading this. I guess in summary, I am very worried. I don’t know whats going on with my body and it’s super scary. I’ve found it really hard to establish a relationship with a doctor who shares my same sense of urgency in seeking answers. Receiving a referral here in the states for any diagnostic procedure other than a US, in my situation, has been a losing battle.
In the event this is something that need serious medical treatment, I want to limit any time wasted. Hell, if I could biopsy it myself I would... although, I’m sure my insurance company would still find a way to bill me :)!

                Hello
About 2.5 months ago i noticed a large lymph node in my groin area. I had a lot going on but made a mental note to keep an eye on it. Then one day last week i noticed it had gotten bigger. I visited my gyn. I expected her to give me antibiotics but instead she made an appointment for an ultrasound and a surgeon. I had my ultrasound yesterday and the result is: 

FINDINGS:  
3 x 1.6 x 0.7 cm hypoechoic lymph node is noted.  
IMPRESSION:  
borderline enlarged right inguinal lymph nodes.  Clinical correlation is recommended.  

From what I gather the oval is a good shape but the hypoechoic may be worrisome?

I have been fatigued for several months. I did have a period of night sweats for about 6 weeks but that has not happened in about a month or so. 

the appointment with the surgeon isn't until mid next week and i'm just trying to make sense of all of this in the meantime. 

Thank you for your help and time.

                So first of all I'm bipolar and I've struggled for the past 2 years but I've been doing pretty well for the past 6 or so months until a couple months ago. I suddenly started to have trouble breathing (like I cant get enough air or have to breathe deep), and then pain all over my body kinda feels like it's my bones or veins. I went to the doctor and she ran a CBC, checked my vitamin levels, EKG, thyroid levels, and a chest xray, everything came out normal. Because of my past they thought it may be psychological and I tried 3 anxiety Meds including klonopin and none helped. I also noticed I've been having itchiness all over my body and a headache which is getting worse (i originally thought it was from dehydration but i cant seem to drink enough water). I also had/have a swollen lymph node from like 8/10 months ago, i noticed it and as far as I know there was no reason for it (sickness or infection). In the beginning the doctors could feel it but weren't worried but more recently the doctors dont really but I still feel like it's not normal and that that area of my neck isnt the same as the other side. With all the test, doctors appointments, trouble breathing, and pain I'm really starting to lose it or maybe it's a symptom because I've been really suicidal but more in the way that I'm desperate for help. Some other things I've noticed is I've been having really weird dreams which I normally dont dream at all or remember. And I'm not sure if it's from depression or what but I feel like my memory is really bad. Finally super random but I get horrible reactions to mosquito bite which I read is a sign of a weakened immune system and a lot of people with lymphoma get worse reactions to mosquitos. I dont really know what to do or if I'm over thinking the signs lining up?

                My son is 4 years old and has had swollen lymph nodes on the back of his neck, under his arm, and in his groin - they've been swollen for over 3 months. The largest node measures 2.8 x 1.5 x .7. He's had numerous rounds of antibiotics, and they haven't gone down. He's had blood work done, which was relatively normal - although he is anemic. He's had a very low grade fever off and on for 2 weeks of around 99-100. He had an abdominal/Pelvis CT done, and it also showed enlarged lymph nodes in his abdomen. He also had an ultrasound which didn't provide much information. His LDH, WBC are normal. His RBC are slightly low. Hemoglobin is low, Hematocrit is low, Monocytes are high, Monos Absolutes are high, Basophils Absolute is high, Eosinophils is high, Neutrophils is high. 
He has a half brother who is in remission from Neuroblastoma. They ruled out any masses/tumors in my child, so I'm sure his isn't Neuroblastoma. I'm wondering if what my son is experiencing sounds like Lymphoma? 
This waiting period is the longest... We have to wait 2 weeks his CT of the neck and chest. We will also be going forward with a lymph node biopsy.

Tomorrow he is getting another CBC ran.

He constantly has rashes. A couple of days ago he had to go to the doctor for a mouth ulcer.



The hematologist is checking for cyclic neutropenia currently with one CBC per week for six weeks. 
Everything I have read says 2-3 CBC's should be done per week for 6-8 weeks. 

Anyone have any suggestions for any testing that needs to be done? 
Is it normal for one CBC per week (for six weeks) to be ordered when testing for cyclic neutropenia?

                Hey, so I'm a 21 year old female. About 2 years ago I started getting abdominal pain. I saw GI and got a colonoscopy and an endoscopy and everything was fine. All my blood work was normal. So my doctor diagnoised me with IBS and gave me a new diet plan, which I followed but it hasn't helped. I started getting really bad nausea and dizziness after a while, so my doctor thought I might have an inner ear infection so she sent me to the ENT and an audiologist bc my ears started ringing and my hearing was getting worse. As it happened, I was diagnoised with CAPD a long time ago, and the audiologist told me that they'd recently discovered that sometimes CAPD can be caused by a lesion on the auditory pathway, so she sent me for a MRI where they discovered a Chiari Malformation. So they sent me to neurosurgery where I was informed I had hydrocephelous which was probably cuasing my headaches and nausea. So they put in a shunt that drains into my abdomen. Shortly after my surgery I started getting chest pain and heart burn and started spitting up bile. My nausea and stomach pain got drastically worse a week ago and my doctor sent me to the ER fearing it was appendicitis. They did a CT scan and my appendix was fine but I was told I had swollen lymph nodes in my abdomen which were probably causing my pain. And then they sent me home. But when I talked to my GP she said that my lymph nodes weren't swollen but were just ""prominent."" She says she can't figure out what's causing my symptoms or what caused my lymph nodes to swell since I haven't had an infection. She threw out Hodgkin's as a suggestion, but didn't look convinced. I'm not either bc while the nodes in my underarms did swell up about 2 weeks ago, they went down after and I don't have any other palpable nodes. Could I have lymphoma that is only in my abdomen?

                I have been experiencing a few worrisome symptoms over the past 6 months, and would like to put my worries to rest. I had a routine physical done by my PCP in the beginning of April. I originally wanted to talk to my doctor because my lymph nodes felt swollen. He didn't think so, so he ordered a thyroid ultrasound for precautionary measures and it came back fine. However, when my blood test results came back, the doctor found my liver enzymes to be elevated. I had another blood test done three weeks later, and my liver enzymes came back high once again, so my PCP ordered an ultrasound of my liver and surrounding abdomen. The ultrasound came back fine, and my doctor wanted me to check back with him in a month. A month passed and I had my third blood test early last week. My liver enzymes came back a bit high, but they were lowering back to normal. I told him about the lymph node behind me ear that is swollen and how I get a radiating, head-ache like pain from it once in a while, but he told me it's nothing to worry about. My doctor wants me to check back in two or three months for another blood test, but in the meantime, I am concerned what it might be since we never found out what has caused these high liver enzymes. I'm 21 years old, I only have about 5 drinks a week, and I'm not on any medications. I originally thought it may have been a case of mono, but I never got the sore throat and fever that is commonly attributed to mono. Also, my girlfriend is showing no symptoms at all.

Some of the symptoms I have been experiencing in addition to the elevated liver enzymes:

-Fatigue
-Swollen lymph nodes (Lymph node behind ear sometimes produces headache like pain)
-Reoccurrence of pain in the joints (fingers, elbow, wrist, armpit, knees) 
-Reoccurrence of dull achey pain in upper right breast (inch above nipple, near armpit), as well as dull achey pain below armpit
-My abdomen feels a lot more tender than it used to be. Whenever my girlfriend rests her head on my abdomen, it feels uncomfortable. Not painful, just an uncomfortable feeling.

Not so often symptoms, but have experienced a few times are:
-Brief, stabbing pain coming from right abdomen behind lower rib cage
-Brief, strange 1-second stabbing pain in pelvic area (interior pain, hard to describe)

Any thoughts on what it could be? Is lymphoma something I should be concerned about? May it actually just be mono? Could it be anything else?

Thank you!

                Hello everyone,

I had an ultrasound on Oct 31 of this year which measured a lymph node in the upper medial thigh at 2.4 x 1.4 x1.0 cm lymph node and no echogenic hilum and there is a peripheral vascular pedicle. The surrounding nodes look ""benign "" and the largest of these is 1.8 x 1.3 x 0.3 with normal echogenic hilum and without hyperemia. Features most consistent with with lymph node. - 

Next i had an ultrasound about 4 days ago by a vascular doctor who did it himself and measured the lymph node at 1.7cm x 1.0 cm.  How do i know that he measured correctly? i mean i saw him measure and saw the numbers but i am so hesitant.  Also my lymphcytes are at 16 and hemoglobin is 11.2 and neutrophils at 73. I am terrified as i am pregnant and have been juicing about 10 lbs of carrots day because i read a book called curing cancer with carrots and know that my options are so limited if this is infact something.  Please if anyone can help or give any insight...my anxiety and ability to enjoy my family and life is almost non existent as i spend hours researching constantly!!!  Thank you in advance.

                I had two surgeries in 2016 and have yet to be the same. Emergency gall bladder and complete hysterectomy at two different times. Ever since gall bladder surgery, i have been so swollen in my arms, hands, face, fingers, stomach.. i am most swollen when I wake, but stay swollen through out the day even with taking a diuretic. My vitamin D stays low even though I’ve been taking 51,000 iu 2X a week for almost a year. It’s only 38. Without the huge doses, it goes way low.. so obviously my body is not retaining it. I have not been able to lose weight and I’m one of the most discipline dieters.. i eat healthy anyway, but I don’t cheat when I’m dieting. My cholesterol is high too. The good cholesterol is low(which should be high) and the bad cholesterol is high... my blood pressure is great. My wbc is 13.2 and my red blood cells are high normal.. i had high absolute lymphocytes and high immature granulocytes. Please help me figure this out....

                Hello, I am extremely worried I have leukemia and I’m hoping for some help interrupting my blood test results. Within the last 2 months, I’ve began to notice easy bruising on my legs and arms. Some of them are big and purple, and they result from a small bumb or even scratching. I finally went to the doctor and they ran some blood tests. The nurse called and said the labs looked ‘ok’ but they wanted to retest in a few weeks. She didn’t really give me much for details, so obviously I’m worrying. I have no other symptoms besides the bruising. I have started 2 new medications around the same time the bruising started, so I’m wondering if they could be related. Flouxitine and the Mirena IUD. I also had a baby 5 months ago. 
My labs are as follows: 

*WBC -13,000 (4-11 is normal range)
*RBC- 5.2x10^6/ul (3.85-5.05 is normal)
*Hemoglobin- 15.6 (11-15.5 is norm)
*Platelets 251 (150-450 is norm)
*Neutrophil- 11 (1-8 is normal range)
*Lymphocyte- 1.3 (1.0-3.9 normal range) 

Also had tests to check blood clotting time and liver and kidney function among other things. Those all fell within normal range.  I should also note, I am just getting over a 10 day cold, sinus, sore throat thing, so I don’t know if that can affect results. And I’ve been suffering from severe postpartum anxiety, so I don’t know if stress can also affect blood counts. I’m very worried. Thank you in advance.

                I have been off work for 8 weeks now, first went to the doctors with lower back pain and fatigue, he did blood tests and my WBC came back slightly raised, had my WBC retested after two weeks and it had raised further and another test two weeks later is had raised again. Tested a urine sample which showed blood +++ but no infection or protein, had a scan on kidneys and bladder and a cystoscopy which were all fine except cysts on my kidneys which i was told were nothing to worry about.

Had another blood test Monday morning, the doctor rang me Monday evening to say my WBC has gon even higher, white cell count is now 21, neutrophills 17.6 and platelets 563, no inflammatory markers at all and no sign of infection anywhere. Only symptoms are lower back pain, extreme tiredness and itchy skin, low grade sore throat with one enlarged gland.

Didnt know if this could be related to a blood cancer as running out of ideas.

I went to the doctor and was tested for MONO, HIV, STD, thyroid, and throat culture; They all came out negative. I am tired, and i have been have extremely bad night chills, and sometimes night sweats, I feel sick after i eat like i want to vomit.. I don't have a fever or cold. I'm schedule to do a biopsy July 6th. I have done the ct scan and it determined i had 1 single enlarge lymph node but 1 month later the 2nd one popped up. Both nodes are hard, but they are move-able, well at least the large one, I can't tell with the pea size one. My left side of my neck hurts. Do you think it could be cancer. I know I wont know for sure till i have the biopsy, maybe somebody went through something similar.

                A couple months ago I found what I suspect to be a lymph node enlarged in my elbow. It's on the inside, body side, immediately above the crease, and at the time was above as long as the first two joints of my index finger (5 cm) and about as big around as my finger. I can only see it when my arm is outstretched, I can neither see nor feel it when my arm is bent. It is painless, although when it is swollen there can be some general achiness in the area that I assume is due to the swelling. I noticed it because the swelling was great enough that it reflected sunlight in a strange manner when I was outside the first day of observation, but it may have been there longer.

I was very alarmed, did some internet research which indicated that elbow lymph node swelling is unusual and can be an indicator of lymphoma. However most doctors would suggest top wait a month first. So I decided to wait.The swelling remained the same for almost that entire month, but did not grow, and then it began to shrink. Now at two months out it is very much reduced and usually in the mornings when I awake it is not evident at all, but it does usually swell up again somewhat during the day. If it was lymphoma or a cancer metastasis it would not come and go like this, correct? I have searched my body - armpits, groin, back of neck - for other enlarged lymph nodes and can find nothing unusual. However the sides of my neck/glands under my jaw have recently begun to swell and ache a bit. I do have allergies, especially to cats, and I am a petsitter so I sneeze a lot some days. I also have an 'arthritis bump' on one joint in my left hand (the elbow swelling is on the right side) and I understand that arthritis flares can also cause some lymph node reactions, although I've have the arthritis bump for almost two years now and never noticed any trouble other than pain in it when the weather changes, etc. Otherwise I seem to be in good health, I'm not having any lymphoma symptoms like night sweats or fatigue or unexplained weight loss. 

I do have one or two lymph nodes on the left side of my neck that have been mildly enlarged for at least 20 years. They blew up in the early 90's when I was drinking/smoking/not sleeping/chronic bronchitis, and never really went all the way back down. Doctors have always just felt them up every year to make sure they are not growing, but they have never been ultra-sounded or anything. 

Any advice would be appreciated, thanks!

                I have had three CT scans with contrast showing multiple lymph nodes up to 2 cm short axis and at my last scan many more possible, though through the shifting of the mesentery that could be unknown. My blood work shows up normal and my doctors want to hold off on a biopsy. If my blood work shows no kind of infection are my doctors just waiting for signs of lymphoma to begin before they opt for the biopsy. I read about the wait and see method when dealing with lymphoma. The doctor says if I show any signs such as night sweats, fatigue-which I do have, changes in bowels or weight loss to come back. I have already been waiting for three and half months since the swelling was noticed in an unrelated CT scan, and that is the hardest part, waiting. Is this normal path for treatment?

                Hi, I have a question for the members of this community. It's regarding my wife and current symptoms. I know that none of you are doctors, but I figured that you would be a good group to ask. I'd appreciate any helpful response. 

Over the past few months, my wife has been loosing weight. She's now less than she was in high school. Her metabolism seemed to be very fast because she was always hungry. I suspected possibly hyperthyroid. We took her in and it was indeed hyperthyroidism, but it corrected itself within two months without treatment. Her thyroid is now normal, but she still is unable to gain weight, she's very fatigued a lot, she may have some new minor depression symptoms, and she's been pretty pale in the face.

Three days ago she noticed a swollen lymph node on her neck. It's tender to the touch, which I was told is a good sign. She told me that day that she was very tired and ached everywhere. She had no fever, but has been complaining of back pain and neck pain for a couple weeks or so. The last few days she has complained a lot of pain almost everywhere, just deep aches she says. Yesterday she was the same, so I told her to get in to the doctor while I was at work, since it was friday. They drew blood and were able to get two results back instantly: CBC and Monospot. She was negative for mono. Her CBC was normal except that her white blood cell count was 2.7, so very low. The doctor was very concerned about the low WBC and ordered other tests, but we wont have those until Monday. (She can't remember what they ordered, so I don't know). The doctor was very concerned that her WBC was so low. She put her on a broad spectrum antibiotic (Cephalexin) to cover any possible bacterial infections that may try to make their way in- so basically the antibiotic is acting as her immune system while her WBC is so low. 

So her symptoms include: fatigue, bone aches, muscle aches (especially thighs, back and neck), slight headaches, pale face, weight loss, swollen lymph node, very low WBC. 

We have a follow up appointment with the doctor on monday to go over results, but she and I are a bit anxious after doing some research on our own. I wanted to ask you all, since most of the research we have done suggests Lymphoma or Leukemia. What is your opinion? Did any of you or your loved ones have these symptoms? I don't know what esle to ask even though there is a lot on my mind. I'd appreciate any helpful input. Thank you.

                Hi all,
I'm 25 y/o female.
I have had a swollen lymph node on the back of my neck for at least three weeks now. Ironically, I found it right after I've been to doctor because of my fatigue and low grade fever. He had my blood tested, and the white cells are in normal. I noticed the node after I came back home. 
I haven't talked to my doctor since, because I wanted to wait a few weeks if it goes away. Until now it's stayed pretty much the same.
About the node: it's not painful at all, and mobile under the skin. It's not very hard, but not squishy either. It has a strange shape too, it's not just oval or round, but has some bumps or edges. It also feels a bit flat. 
Silly thing is, I've noticed having a bump on my neck months ago, told myself I should check on it, and forgot about it. So I'm not sure if I've had it all that time or not.

Is there anyone who has experienced something similar? Should I be worried and run to a doctor, or should I chill and wait it out? I went a bit too deep into googling stuff, so I hope I'm just scaring myself.

Thanks.

                I had bloodwork done last week and a complete metabolic panel. Everything came back normal, except my A/G ratio was slightly higher than what the lab considers in the normal range. I asked my doctor and he said don't worry, that it was nothing, and then he hung up the phone. I googled what a high A/G ratio can mean and I saw where it said it could indicate certain leukemias and I got upset. Am I worrying for nothing? Also, why is my A/G ratio high when my albumin and globulin levels are totally normal? My scores are below:

Protein, total, serum: 6.9 g/dl  normal lab range: 6.0 - 8.5

                Hi there. For a long time (almost 2 years now) I haven't been feeling well at all. Finally starting to figure out part of what's going on with me so I consider myself 1/2 there :)  I have a lot of crap going on including possible lymphoma or Sarcoidosis or another autoimmune disease. Even though my blood work seems fairly normal, is it possible to still have lymphoma? 

I have swollen lymph nodes in my neck which has enlarged some and became tender within the last couple weeks (not a lot but enough to notice)
lymph nodes in my neck, also my chest traveling all the way down my stomach into my abdomen 
persistent fatigue
unexplained weight loss  
trouble breathing
chills
weak
achy muscles
a little joint pain
headaches
and sometimes just feel sick ... 

I've had a CT scan which found all those lymph nodes, biopsy turned out negative (yay) though my oncologist still wants to do a PET Scan esp. with the symptoms I told him about (He seemed pretty concerned with the weight loss and the chills I've been getting) so Thursday I should be getting that unless my insurance denies it which they better not .. So gunna check for lymphoma and Sarcoidosis and who knows if anything else and compare with the CT scan I got last month. 

I guess I'm wondering if any one has had a fairly normal CBC and still has been diagnosed with lymphoma?  normally my WBC is a little elevated it's usually between 12 - 19 .. but once in a while like today it'll be normal.

                I am a frequent smoker of marijuana. The past couple months I have started to feel tired and have been getting frequent infections. I get small red spots under my skin and I bruise very easy. My face has gotten very pale and I have massive bags under my eyes that look like bruises. I have sharp pains in all my bones and have really bad hip and knee pain. I also get bloody noses and they last sometimes for more than an hour. I have gotten 2 CBCs in the last 6 months and came back normal for the most part besides a blood smear that showed neutropenia and on the low end of normal platelet count. I have had a hunch I had leukemia the last couple months but I didn’t want to tell my doctor I smoke weed. I’m not sure if marijuana is something that can effect your CBC, but I’d love to find out because I’m still worried I have leukemia.

                Okay so, I’m not sure if I possibly have leukemia or if I’m just overthinking it. 2 weeks ago, I noticed an abnormally large bruise along my spinal cord. I couldn’t and still cannot recall of a time that I possibly may have injured my back enough to bruise it like that. Recently, I’ve spotted many new bruises on my legs for which I still do not recall. For the past 2 weeks, my mother has also noticed that I’ve been going to sleep around 9 pm (very abnormal for me) instead of 11 pm like I normally do. I’ve been getting tired very easily, and small physical activity tires me very quick. Now you may be thinking, “Maybe you’re anemic.” Which I have been anemic before, but this seems to be worse to me. For this whole past week, everytime I have blown my nose, there is always a tad of blood along with it. Another symptom I’ve been having recently is aching. My whole entire back, hips, and legs have all been hurting recently. I have also been having many headaches in the past 2 days, and today I almost fell over because I was so lightheaded. I have an appointment to get my blood tested tomorrow (I am a female 13 year old) so I will get results, but I’m so anxious right now, and I’m curious if any of you may know what’s up..?

                I went to the university campus doctor because the lymph nodes in my neck have been swollen and tender since late January and now the ones under my arms have started to swell. I also have been majorly fatigued/weak the entire semester and my arms/legs will randomly start tingling and my nails will turn blue. Also, I've been getting extreme aches in my legs, like I have the flu or something (I don't). The Dr tested for mono (it was negative), CBC, Sed rate, and C-Reactive Protein. My WBC was 12.0 - Neutrophils were 8.6 (72.1%), Lymphocytes were 2.3 (19.2%), and the other ones were at normal levels. Also, I have low MCH, MCHC, and MCV. My sedimentation rate was flagged as high, as was my C-Reactive Protein (7.5). I never get fevers even when super sick, and I don't have one now. Also, I've lost 10lbs since December and I keep getting a weird skin rash (red circles?) that doesn't go away with antibiotics or antifungals. It's not itchy and the spots come and go randomly. Three days ago I started feeling so nauseous and weak that I couldn't stand up for almost 10 minutes and I couldn't feel my hands.
These are really strange symptoms and I don't even know if they are related but they all got worse around the same time, though, so maybe. You'd think with the numb hands and fatigue/weakness that it would be anemia but my CBC says all that stuff is fine. My main question is - does this sound like some sort of virus/bacterial infection, or leukemia/lymphoma? I've been googling all my lab results and I'm getting a little freaked out.

                I do have a little anxiety going on.

I have had a sore lymph node, im assuming for amost a week, its one thats never really gotten sore in the past. 
its right under the jaw corner, straight below the ear.

I cant really touch it, b/c its in a spot i really have to work, bend the chin down to really get to/feel.

It only hurts really, when i suck through a straw, or suck in my lips. and sometimes when chewing.

Last Wednesday, I remember crying really hard, and then Thursday, I woke up and it was sore. Then Friday, I noticed a small canker sore developing in my mouth.

Then yesterday, I thought I felt a discomfort in my left armpit... so i started messing with it, wiggling fingers around etc, and I think I am just thinking WAY too much about it, and am WAY too in-tune with my body right now as an anxiety sufferer.

My lymph nodes are probably pea size or lyma bean size, all normal... no noticeable swelling, just sore in that one in the neck.

Do you think it's just from the canker sore? Do you think my armpit feels a bit uncomfy today b/c i kept playing with it sort of yesterday?

Ive got a Dr's appt. today to give me a bit of peace of mind. I'm sure it's nothing, everyone tells me its nothing and to quit worrying.

I have NO symptoms of Lymphoma, yet I still have a cancer scare, since I suffer from anxiety.

I have NO night sweats, I have no sudden weight loss, I do a little bit of appetite loss but thats probably only b/c that started when i started worrying about it, I've had NO fevers or anything...

My back has been a tad achy, and tense, so has the back of my neck, pretty tensed up. I have been under some stress. My throat is not sore, but it feels tense sometimes too.

So I'm sure I'm fine. I probably should have waited til my canker sore left in another week or so and waited to see if the lymph node pain went away afterwards. But, hey, if it gives me peace of mind, then cool.

Thanks for reading.

                Background: 25 year old woman who’s generally healthy. Average height and weight. 

About two and a half weeks ago, I began having pain and tenderness in the left side of my neck, specifically near the lymph node right under my jaw bone. No other symptoms were present at this time aside from and overall fatigued feeling and headache. 

The pain and tenderness didn’t subside and 5 days later, it began on the right side of my neck. However, this time, I felt a large, hard lump to the right of my Adam’s apple. This was tender and painful and immovable when pressed. At this time I still had no upper respitory or other symptoms other than a headache so I went to my GP on Monday, March 26th. She found several prominent swollen nodes in my neck and ran a full blood count along with tests for lupus and thyroid diseases, including hoshimotos (given familial history). She also referred me to get an ultrasound on my neck as soon as possible to see if the nodes themselves were enlarged or there was a mass. 

The night after I went to the GP I began running a fever of 101 with chills and lower back pain. I called the next morning to tell her about the extreme back pain and she prescribed me medication to treat a possible kidney infection or sepsis, as I had thought I may have had a UTI a couple weeks back but symptoms had passed after one day. Prescribed a three day, twice a day strong antibiotic (started w a c, can’t remember the name). 

My fever continues and I go to the ultrasound on Wednesday, March 28th, where they find some of my lymph nodes are rounded and several enlarged. One is 1.5 cm (normal lymph nodes should not exceed 10 mm). I still have a persistent low grade fever (all hours of the day, but relieved with anti fever medication, aspirin). Results of the ultrasound recommend I should get a CT scan as soon as possible. By this time my blood work returns as well. No mono, no lupus, no flu, no connective tissue disorders, no thyroid issues. All it shows is an elevated “new white blood cell” count and sedementation rate was elevated. Everything else normal. By this time I’m beginning to experience loss of appetite as well. This will continue. 

Friday, March 30th I receive a CT scan with contrast. My low grade fever still persists. This Saturday the right start of my throat starts to hurt as well. Almost like a razor blade. 

Monday, April 2nd, I receive some unsettling results from my CT scan. “Prominent enhancing lymph nodes with mild surrounding inflammatory change and heterogenous appearance. The largest node on the right, at level 2a is 19x9x26 mm. And additional node on the right is 13x9x22mm. On the left, on node 2a is 21x9x26 mm. One more significant on the left 2b is 15x10x23. 

Other than the lymph nodes, all other aspects of the UR are unremarkable. Conclusion: nonspecific bilateral adenopathy with surrounding inflammatory changes. Infectious and inflammatory causes such as Kikuchi and castlemans disease are considered. Neoplasm such as lymphoma is also in the differential. Reccomend tissue sampling.   

I have a fine needle biopsy scheduled for next Monday (had to wait bc I’ve been taking antiinflamatory medication). As a side note, my dr told me she’s worried on the phone. What dr says they’re worried?! She reccomended biopsy as soon as possible. But I’m at a loss! I still have a low grade fever, chills, loss of appetite and the sore throat has nearly subsided. Sometimes periods of hot flashes (maybe as my fever breaks). Anyone have similar symptoms? I can’t help but panic thinking it’s lymphoma, as my grandma has non-hodgkins lymphoma. Any suggestions are greatly appreciated. Please help.

                I am a 24 year old male. I have been having something resembling globus symptoms for almost 6 months. In May, after a particularly stressful period  I began to develop a very moderate general pain in my arm pits. There are no palpable lumps whatsoever. I check daily. The weird thing is that the pain seems to come and go at random. However, I notice that when I am lifting weights I can feel the pain. I stopped lifting weights for over a week thinking it was a muscular problem, however, the pain would come and go as it had before. The weirdest thing is that whenever I was done washing my armpits in the shower, I feel this rubbing of my armpit skin that feels like it is swollen or something. However, there is no visible sign of swelling. So, after freaking out reading about lymphoma I went to my GP. He felt around and said he had no idea what was going on. Well, it has been over a month and I still have it coming and going. I have constant throat issues, so I went to the ENT and he said I just happen to have huge tonsils that don't look infected or worrisome. He prescribed me some generic prilosec because it looks like I have some acid reflux affecting my larynx. The globus sensation is now gone, but I still feel my tonsils and my voice is still slightly weaker than usual. My questions are as follows: What could be causing the armpit discomfort? Are the arm pit and throat feelings related? Should I push to have my tonsils removed, and if so, would this make anything better? Any advice you have on next steps would be helpful. As for my thyroid I had two post hemorrhagic cysts and the doctor would just like to monitor their development over the next few months with a follow up sonogram.

Low level vascularity and says nodes are not typically reactive. His doctor and sent him urgent referal to both surgeon for biopsy and haematologist/oncologist.

                I am a frequent smoker of marijuana. The past couple months I have started to feel tired and have been getting frequent infections. I get small red spots under my skin and I bruise very easy. My face has gotten very pale and I have massive bags under my eyes that look like bruises. I have sharp pains in all my bones and have really bad hip and knee pain. I also get bloody noses and they last sometimes for more than an hour. I have gotten 2 CBCs in the last 6 months and came back normal for the most part besides a blood smear that showed neutropenia and on the low end of normal platelet count. I have had a hunch I had leukemia the last couple months but I didn’t want to tell my doctor I smoke weed. I’m not sure if marijuana is something that can effect your CBC, but I’d love to find out because I’m still worried I have leukemia.

Moreover, Before 6 months and 4 months done same test. WBC was 11500. 
I am thinking about, why the WBC decreased.

I had gone to doctor for Swallowing problem and pain in the tongue and throat.
Doctor done endoscopy of Upper GI and everything normal.
Another question is does upper GI endoscopy covers throat and tongue conditions also or not.
Are there any infection in the body that representing by  this blood test.

                Hello group,

I've been dealing with some anxiety since my blood test (my Dr appt is on monday) and looking for some of your knowledge.

I had a blood test yesterday and results show a WBC of 2.9 and also low neutrophils of .60 (meaning I have moderate neutropenia). All other values are within range.

I had a blood test done a year ago and everything was good then (WBC of 5.6).

I don't have a fever or additional symptoms and don't think I have a virus.

I have as few questions:

1. Could this be a normal swing in my WBC, is it fairly common for healthy people to drop low and bounce back up?

2. If this was something more serious, like leukemia, would my other values also be out of range (Is it a good sign that it's only WBC)?

3. When I google ""low WBC"" it shows some scary causes. How worried should I be over 1 blood test showing moderate neutropenia?

4. Should I be staying home or wearing a face mask? How dangerous is it to be out in public for me right now with such a weak immune system?

I haven't  been sick  (cold, flue) in years and I have young kids who are always sick. I have to believe this low WBC is something that had just happened within the last week. So maybe I just did the test at a bad time, when mybimmune system was weak?

I really appreciate any thoughts you can share.

I haven't been able to relax and keep worrying about the worst.

Thanks and be well!

                It started 4 years ago which i got longest fever of my life (for 1 month) and every evening it can goes to 39 and even 40 degree celsius. Doctors conducted lots of blood and urine tests, X-Rays, CTs, but in vein. At last it disappeared by itself. During that months, i ate many antibiotics and anti-fever pills. 
Right after one year, it came again. this time it lasts for 25 days and then gone. The next year, it came again. But this time, with a swollen Lymph node at left of my throat. Doctor performed fine needle Biopsy and confirmed Lymph node TB and this is how I started to eat TB course along with Liver protection pills.
10 months has passed, and the medication worked. My lymph node got smaller than before but (as usual) i got fever again.
As I keep monitoring my Liver and Kidney Functionality on monthly basis, my LFT report shows high Red Blood Cells (50 uL) in Urine and well as RBCH is also high (9.1 HPF). All other parameters are normal. It is very confusing the reason of constant fever again (at the same time interval of the year). It is not supposed to happen as i have already detected TB and curing it well. Please advice what can be the other possibilities?

                I have two very large posterior lymph nodes; about 4 cm in diameter, they look like ping pong balls inside my skin when I bend my head to the side. There is one large on on each side of my neck (bilateral) which is good news. There are smaller, but still enlarged, lymph nodes according the one on my right side which are each 2 cm or less. I’ve had one swollen one for years that never went away and I assumed it was from scarring. It has gotten larger in recent months and the small ones have started popping up, as well as the one on the other side of my neck.

I have no other symptoms at all except for being hot at night occasionally. (Not necessarily sweating) The nodes are firm but moveable to an extent, and are not tender at all. 

I’m not sure if I should be concerned or not.

                I’m a 17yo female and weigh about 125-128 ( my weight fluctuates) which is about the normal weight for a teenager my age. In 8th grade to my freshman year of high school I was about 150lbs give or take and by my junior year I lost about 20lbs. It wasn’t a sudden weight loss but I definetly dropped a few sizes through the course of 2 or 3 years without doing anything to change my weight. I started to work out once I noticed my weight kinda evened out but that didn’t change my weight much. I can’t eat a full meal in one sitting and I haven’t been able to for about a year or two and almost every time I eat I get full even after just a small sandwich and a glass of water or anything. My lymphnodes have been swollen for as long as I can remember and my chiropractor noticed a nodule under my left collarbone towards my shoulder. It’s not painful but it is an uncomfortable feeling when it moves. I also have a hard lump that’s pretty flat just under my right clavicle. I’ve recently developed a cough but my lymph nodes have been swollen long before it came up and I often have trouble getting a full deep breath and I begin to yawn profusely because I’m unable to get a satisfying breath. I also burp a lot when I lay down and when I poke my lower stomach it hurts. I have more symptoms but I think this paragraph is long enough and gives enough info for someone to make a comment.

                I have been diagnosed with Stage IIIA Hodgkin Lymphoma, Nodular Sclerosis, and have undergone two doses of ABVD. I had intense scrotal itch which dates back two years, and still persists today. I am 23 and I have not ever had any issues with scrotal itching. In the first year of my scrotal itch, the itching was only limited to the sides of my scrotum. There was no oozing. No matter how much I scratched. Hydrocortisone usually solves the itch. 

In last few months, my scrotum started to ooze a clear fluid whenever I scratched too intensely. The fluid will then harden, forming a layer on top of my scrotum. Breakage of this layer will result in further oozing. If no further insult occurs, the layer will flake off, revealing a normal-looking scrotum without rashes or redness. The process then repeats itself. In the last few weeks, the itch had spread to my perianal region and my inner thighs. There are two patches of white dry skin on both my inner thighs. The white skin disappears upon moisturising. 

Can the scrotal itching be due to my cancer? Or could it be scrotal eczema or a fungal infection?

I am not a cancer patient but a son of one looking for support and to hear stories from other patients.

My mom(65 years old) was diagnosed with diffused large B cell lymphoma(DLBCL, left upper arm) a month ago.

 

DLBCL was discovered during liver transplantation preparation due to liver cirrhosis.

So, liver transplantation is aborted.

Chemotherapy is not possible because her liver failure by cirrhosis is severe.

Doctor said, radiotherapy will not be treated because there’s no possibility of complete recovery. And he stopped all active treatment.

 

He said her life expectancy would be less than 1 month.

 

Is there any possible way to treat it?

Any new drug, or experimental treatment methods?

                Hi all,

I posted a question about all my symptoms in the Anxiety thread because I'm not sure if I'm just being a hypochondriac or if I need to be more proactive with my health.

About 6 weeks ago I noticed in the shoulder/neck area on my left side I had a small little lump (feels like less than 1cm, almost like a pea maybe?). I figured I was getting sick (sure enough 2 weeks later I had bronchitis, bad cough, fever, and went on a Z-pack). I'm a 20 year old healthy male with psoriasis (hasn't really acted up much my father has it too it got worse as he got older). Family history is very healthy. I quit smoking when I was 18 I was stupid in high school so that always fuels my cancer fears. Basically the lump is painless, it moves around under the skin and doesn't feel hard. I can't find it right away either, I have to feel for it a bit and usually I can only feel it when I move it, if I run my fingers over my neck/shoulder it doesn't stand out. 

Anyways I do have left shoulder/neck/TMJ issues so I regularly see a chiro and physical therapist to loosen it up since I work out regularly. Today while massaging my shoulder I felt it again by the neck and was surprised it was still there, I figured it would've been gone by now. It feels the exact same as when I first felt it but now I'm freaking out about it still being here. I've had some other weird symptoms over the past year (eye floaters, after images, anxiety, twitches) that I've gotten better with but I'm so worried about this node now I can't help it. I have no night sweats or weight loss. I do have some itchy skin but I've had that for a while and it's gotten better.

Am I just overreacting?

                I have had a swollen lymph node in my neck for quite some time. A few years ago when I first noticed it, my PCP (GP) said it was probably because I had mono (A blood test confirmed that I had mono in the past). Since then, it has not grown, and it is approximately 1-2cm. I was not worried about it up until a few months ago, when I started experiencing some concerning symptoms. It started off with flu-like symptoms, which never really went away. 3 weeks later, I developed bumpy rashes on my arms and legs that seemed to only flare up in a hot bath or at night. I was also experiencing unusually itchy skin that was also worsened by heat. Shortly after the rashes appeared, I started having low grade fevers every day. There would be days (and mostly nights) when my fevers would spike up and cause me to start sweating. Then the sweating started to be a lot more noticeable at night. I still have these temperature swings. I have also been experiencing some chest discomfort and breathlessness, which I have just attributed to my overwhelming and debilitating fatigue. In the last 3 weeks, I have noticed an almost complete decrease in my appetite and severe abdominal pain, accompanied with digestion problems, loss of appetite, and a 15 pound weight loss. I haven't been able to exercise like I used to, and I have been trying to force myself to eat just to keep some weight on, as I am almost underweight for my age. I have been to several doctors who don't seem concerned, and have gone as far to tell me that I am a hypochondriac. Several CBC's in the last few months have shown up to be completely normal. Extensive blood testing has shown that I do not have any acute or lingering infection.

Should I be worried about these symptoms being lymphoma? I have an appointment with a different doctor this week, and if you have any advice on questions I should ask (about further testing they could do, a different way to explain my symptoms, etc.) please let me know!

Not sure if this is related, but I have also been experiencing low back/flank pain for weeks that feels like my kidneys, but I do not have a UTI and my kidneys are functioning up to par. Could this flank pain possibly be related to my other symptoms?

Thank you, xx

                My physician has been concerned with my symptoms, and referred me to a hematologist/oncologist in worry of a possible lymphoma. I have had a 2cm palpable lymph node on my neck (posterior cervical) for over a year. It seems to be slightly waxing and waning. I have several smaller ones about the size of a pea also located in my neck, and a recent one in my groin. In the past 3 months, I started to notice other concerning symptoms; persistent low grade fever with spikes of high fevers (99.5-101.8), terrible night sweats, rashes and severe itching (especially at night, in a hot bath, or anytime I am running a high fever or hot), 13lb weight loss in the last 3 weeks, (this is over 10% of my original body weight), chest pains and a mild cough along with breathlessness, loss of appetite, bone pains, and extreme, overwhelming fatigue. All of my symptoms have been developing over these past 3 months, as well as progressively getting worse.

I have been to several doctors and specialists but I haven't gotten any answers. My physician has done multiple labs, and has checked everything that he could think of. I have been referred to a rheumatologist, neurologist, gastroenterologist (I have had Celiac Disease my whole life, but it is inactive during this time), and a hematologist/oncologist. None of the specialists are concerned. Yesterday was my first hematology appointment. They said they weren't concerned with lymphoma because ""it would show up in a CBC and other blood tests."" However, they proceeded to do another CBC just to have it on record, and it came back abnormal. My CBC's have been normal in recent past, but yesterday there were some unusual abnormalities (high wbc, but normal rbc and platelets). When the hematologist saw that there were abnormalities, he said he wasn't concerned. From extensive testing, we know that I don't have an acute infection that would raise my wbc. I have had mono in the past; I tested positive for that prior to my Celiac diagnosis years ago. So with no acute infection and a randomly abnormal CBC, how could any doctor not investigate further, ESPECIALLY considering my concerning symptoms and risk factors???? So let us get this straight. The hematologist said that he would only be really considering lymphoma if my counts were abnormal, but he wasn't the least bit alarmed when they came back abnormal. Everyday my symptoms are progressively getting worse. I do have another appointment with the hematologist next week, as well as an appointment with a new gastroenterologist hopefully sometime next week too. 

I have had a routine chest X-ray 5 months ago which was before any of my symptoms (was normal), an abdominal X-ray recently (which showed some shading; the doctor said I was probably just constipated), and abdominal ultrasound recently (which is normal), and various & extensive blood testing.

My physician wants an abdominal MRI and a chest X-ray, but the hematologist says that they are both unnecessary. I don't feel like it is their call to make, especially because of their contradicting point of view.

For anyone who has been or knows someone who was diagnosed with Lymphoma, what testing/imaging was done on you/them? Or if anyone has any information on how Lymphoma has/has not affected yours/their blood work. I have heard that it is rare for Lymphoma to show up on blood work.

                I recently had soreness by my left jaw and went poking around thought I felt a lymph node. So I went and saw my PCP right away because I had hodgkins lymphoma 7 years ago and he could not feel anything. So he had me do a CBC and everything was perfect. I than started poking around again and found two nodes but they are very mobile. I have to really move my head around to get at them. So I went back to see him and he examined me again and found the small one but he said he only got a quick feel. I guess right now I am a little nervous. I feel confident in my doctor but at the same time my history wont let me relax. The nodes are not obvious and could not be felt without really contorting my head. If the nodes stay the same and do not get bigger is that ok?

                Hey I think I might have lymphomas. At first I was thinking it could be hiv because I had unprotected sex but I got test negative with 4th generation test at 7 and a half weeks(people says it's conclusive but not so sure). My symptoms I'm having right now that I makes me think that I have it is I have white tongue, my collarbone is showing more than usual (weight loss), and I think I get like a mild fever that comes and goes I get hot really easy and it's feels like fever but as soon as I take the covers off, it goes away. I also get itch but no indication of rash but sometimes it shows up like a bug bite and goes away in an hour or so. My neck pretty stiff too. I also have a irritation around my butt crack and sometimes itches and a strange odor. Do you think that I could have lymphomas? How can I find out if I do or not? I also been stressing out a lot because I thought I could have hiv so haven't slept well for couple days.

                Hi Everyone, I have hit a brick wall with the Healthcare system (NHS) and was wondering if anyone can please help me.

Dec 2016 - I started with a sore throat

January 2017 - The sore throat was worse and I also felt like I had something stuck in the left hand side of my throat.

February 2017 - I noticed my tonsils and lymph nodes were getting swollen and the pain was getting worse. 
I went to the doctors many times over Jan - March 2017 and kept telling them that the pain feels similar to the pain from tonsillitis. (I had 5-6 bouts of tonsillitis over 2015 & 2016). Every doctor I saw said my lymph nodes feel swollen but as I had no pus in my tonsils they couldn't help me due to no signs of bacterial infection.

April 2017 - My symptoms had greatly worsened, the pain was excruciating and I had to use diphlam spray and cocodamol daily. I was extremely tired constantly, had dizzy spells daily, hoarse voice daily, sharp ear pains, my tonsils were massive and my lymph nodes were really swollen and sore. I cried in the doctors office begging to be taken seriously. As a result he referred my to an ENT. The ENT felt my swollen lymph nodes had a look at my throat and said we'll take your tonsils out. 

May 2017 - I had a tonsillectomy.

August 2017 - All symptoms as above still present (I left it a few months to see if it would all get better after the tonsillectomy). I also started having sharp lung pains whenever I worked out so I had to stop going to the gym. I went back to my doctor, he confirmed lymph nodes still swollen and he referred me back to ENT.

September 2017 - ENT had a look up my nose and down throat with a flexible camera, said my lymph nodes are swollen and my Pharynx is swollen and inflamed. He sent me for an MRI scan which turned out clear.

October 2017 - I begged the ENT to do more tests as my symptoms were stopping me from going to work and from living my life. I was in pain constantly, and it started to become difficult to talk and swallow due to the pain in my lymph nodes, especially the ones under my ears. I also said that one of the lumps under my right ear had grown more and was rock hard and unmovable which was different to the rest.  He referred me for an ultrasound.

Beginning of November 2017 - Whilst waiting for the ultrasound appointment I had a look at the back of my throat myself and pushed/pressed on my swollen Pharynx, this made loads of yellow/green pus appear at the back/top of my throat. I took a photo for proof and went to my GP, they gave me a 10 day penicillin antibiotic course. After finishing the course the pus had stopped appearing but all other symptoms still present.

29th November 2017 - Ultrasound says my lymph nodes are reactive (which I already knew as every doctor I have seen over the past year has told me they are swollen). They've said there's a million reasons why they could be reactive and that they do not look malignant so they're not taking it any further and have discharged me from the hospital.

I really don't know what to do now. My throat is ridiculously sore at either side (right where my lymph nodes are), my neck is extremely tender where the nodes are, my ears have sharp shooting pains and dull constant pain and I feel so tired all the time.

I am worried about Lymphoma as with having swollen lymph nodes for a whole year now. But I have read that if they hurt then it doesn't suggest lymphoma.
I am also worried about having Strep Throat that is not being adequately treated as I have read that if it spreads to your lungs and organs it can shut them down and kill you.

Has anyone experienced anything like this or have any advice please I would greatly appreciate it?

                So, I am 19 years old and in college and about twelve weeks ago I had sex with someone I didn't know and the condom broke... you could imagine all the stress I've been through. During the course of these past weeks, I have tested negative for HIV with 4th generation tests and RNA tests, so I stopped worried about that. Three weeks after the encounter I started feeling weird, I noticed I was kinda tired and felt like staying in bed all day even though my temperature readings never went over 99.0 F. I got extremely worried though when five weeks after the encounter I noticed that my lymph nodes on my neck and under my jaw were swollen overnight... and they have been swollen for the past seven weeks. A week after that I finally decided to go the GP, and she told me that they were swollen and she sent me home with a course of antibiotics and an antinfungal pill cause I thought my tongue was white... but she wanted to run some tests: she ordered a bunch of blood tests like cytomegalovirus, CBC, mononucleosis, HIV and also X-rays. She told me to come in a week after that to discuss the results. I went back and she told me that everything was clear but there test for mono came back positive but she couldn't tell me if it was recent or from my childhood and I don't remember ever having mono but who knows... I told my dad about it (who is a doctor) and he told me not to worry about it and that if I want we can go to the specialist back home after finals are done for peace of mind. My swollen lymph nodes are still swollen, they hurt when I push them and I can play or move them around when I put my neck down and feel them through my skin. My back has also been hurting but that may be from the sleepless nights and anxiety I guess.

I've been seen a therapist and she has helped but I am still incredibly scared because I am only 19 years old and I know Hodgkin's lymphoma is common in my age group... at this point, I don't know what to think but I just want to know if I should pursue this or just leave it like that... The GP told me not to worry about it at all and that I can sleep now cause it would've shown in the blood tests.

I don't really know what to think and would appreciate any help cause this has been driving me insane. Nodes are still swollen.

Once in a while, I have been dizzy as well. My doctor has done numerous blood tests, swabs, a chest x-ray, a head CT scan, and I'm scheduled for a CT scan of my abdomen in a few days. So far, my tests haven't shown anything, except my WBC is low (3.7 K/uL), my MCHC was slightly low, and my NRBC was high. My primary care doctor doesn't seem concerned, but has sent my information to an infectious disease specialist for analysis. The only thing she has mentioned to me is that she wants to conduct the CT f my abdomen to see if I have hidden cancer in that region. Cancer wasn't on my radar until she blurted this out. Has anyone diagnosed with cancer started off with similar symptoms?

                Since about two weeks ago, I started feeling aching in the armpit area (where the breast meets the armpit mainly) and under chin and different spots around neck/clavicle and arms where the lymph nodes would be in the forearm area, and also the wrists. 

My lymph nodes in my neck (the ones underneath my jaw) feel swollen and bigger than ""normal"", but when I look in the mirror I don't see any lumps protruding. The swollen feeling makes me feel like my throat and upper chest feel very constricted. I still have aching in the armpits at times where if I massage that area it feels sore. I can get these enflamed, tingling, prickly sensations in the armpit area that extends to my upper chest and arms. Also have felt fatigued at times, and had stiff neck and stiff shoulder muscles. 

I went to the doctor and he felt for any lumps in my armpits, neck and groin and did not find any. I took a CBC test and everything was normal. He felt that it's just a viral infection if anything. 

I can get anxious about my health but the sore armpits have really been bothering me, but without any lumps can I rule out lymphoma?

                Thank you for any assistance you can all give me. First off, I have been having swelling on the left side of my neck for some time now. I have suspected that it was my wisdom teeth causing this because I have needed them pulled for some time now. My top wisdom teeth are decayed and falling apart(They are so hard to take care of!) and do occassionally have pain in them when I bite down on them. but the bottom ones are coming in really crooked and dont have any pain from them.  I have gone to the dentist and will be getting them pulled in 1 month. About 2 or 3 weeks ago, I noticed a lump or bump under my Jawline on that same side. I instantly got worried about that but still thought it was my wisdom teeth causing this. I received antibiotics from my dentist and took them all as directed. But i dont see or feel any changes in the swelling. The lump is not painful, but I can feel the swelling in my neck, especially when I swollow. I have just scheduled an appointment with an Ear,Nose and neck doctor to see what it may be. I am just wondering what you all might think it is? Is it the wisdom teeth (tooth infection). Is it something more serious like cancer? Thank you for any information you can give me!

                Recently I have had a cold and seem to have enlarged lymph nodes in my neck area. I understand that having a cold can create enlarged lymph nodes by the ones I have are completely painless and are not tender at all. Also, I seem to have had these appear towards the end of my cold when it has started to clear up slightly (just have a bit of a cough left over). I have also read that painless lymph nodes have been linked to HIV and Lymphoma. I have always been able to feel painless lymph nodes in my neck, armpit and groin (less than at the moment because I'm ill) 

1) Is it painless to have painless lymph nodes while having a cold?

2) Can lymph nodes sometimes enlarge towards to end of an illness when it starts to clear up?

3) I have read that painless lymph nodes are exclusive to HIV and Lymphoma - is this true?

Cheers in advance

I understand you are not here to diagnose me, but I would really appreciate you helping me figure out should I start panicking or not, based on your experience.
I'm a 27 year old female. Have not been to the doctor's in ages, I'm the type of person to easily brush off everything as a common cold and power through it myself.
About 3, 4 months ago, I have noticed I started to get really seriously fatigued all day, every day. Like, barely keeping my eyes open at work fatigued, even though then I had no trouble sleeping. If I could have, I would have slept 20 hours of the day. I have also noticed I was getting out of breath very easily, especially while going uphill or up the steps. I would literally feel faint how out of breath I was getting. I have also lost around 11, 12 pounds in the last 3, 4 months, without consciously dieting (I now look very frail and unhealthily skinny). I have found a lump on the left side of my neck which is around 1,5 cm and one on the back of my head, near the hearline, which is at least 2,3 times the size of the first one. The first one feels rubbery, but the bigger one feels very hard and unmoveable.

I went to the doctor when I notices the first one, a little over a month ago, when it was only bean-sized. She did some bloodwork, everything seemed fine except my hemoglobin was on the lower side of the normal range, lymphocytes were a little higher than normal, and neutrophils were a bit lower than normal. She said it seemed like an infection and refered me to an infectologyst. He assured me he can see no signs of an infection, at all.

Now, that was over a month ago. Both of the nodes seem to have swelled up a tiny bit more. I have started feeling this weird pain and slight, tender swelling down my neck on the left side, around my collarbone, and around my armpit, above my breast. No lumps in those regions that I can feel, just the slight swelling, and the skin feels warmer than normal there. I have also had a slightly raised temperature of around 99.5 for 3, 4 days now, mostly in the evenings, accompanied with chills throughout most of the day. I have had no night sweats, but have been sweating more than usual, in general, for over a month. Also, my throat feels tight, but is not painful. Just like it's difficult for me to swollow. Some itching all over the body is there, but I have attributed it to dry skin due to colder weather.

I guess my question is, should I worry? I am planning to schedule an appointment with my GP next week, and ask her if we can to an ultrasound of the nodes, because I have been getting progressively worse, I feel like.

Thank you so much in advance for reading this, would really appreciate your input!

                I am 60 and was diagnosed with CLL last year.  I've gone in four times for follow-up labs and am now on a yearly watch.  It's running an indolent course, but I'm a little confused by some of the labs.  My WBC has remained stable between 12-15, but each lab results shows a pattern of the Lymphocytes increasing from the each previous lab.  ALC was at 5, but now is 9.  The platelets have been trending down with each lab as well, but still in normal range.  Was at 256, but now is 188.  Neutrophils are at 15%.  Is this a normal pattern with CLL where the WBC are stable, but the Lymphocytes and Neutrophils are not, along with the platelets?  I had a recent neck MRI which showed the bone marrow as somewhat heterogenous, which I was told was related to the CLL.  I only have a small pea size lymph node in my neck, but other than bruising easily and fatigue (for which I take Modafinil due to fighting sleep all day), I'm in good shape.

                Hello,

I am a 20 year old female who has been experiencing swollen lymph nodes in the groin area for about 2 days after i consume alcohol. Muscle soreness is also present during this time. I have been taking Doxycycline for acne purposes since late august. I have had my tonsils and adenoids taken out when I was 16 because of frequent infection and one tonsil constantly swollen. Other than this, I a have been healthy. When i first noticed the swollen gland in my groin, i went to the gyno. He told me that he thought it was just my lymph nodes clearing up a virus, and to come back in a month. I was supposed to go back a day ago, but got my period. This recently happened a second time after i drank alcohol the night before. What do you think this is? I thought it may be hodgkin's disease, and looked up the symptoms, and i do not have any of the night sweats, fever, or painless swollen nodes. However, I am worried about this. Should I go see the doctor earlier than my rescheduled appointment for January 17th? This will be about 2 months after my first episode of swollen nodes in the groin area.  Thanks again.

                So please bare in mind that my insurance will not become active until March 1st, so this is all very preemptive for me.  I have every plan to go to the doctor's once my insurance is effective, but until then, I'm sort of just curious.

I'm a 20 year old female, and generally healthy.  I had mono about 3 years ago, but that has both come and gone, and I have been fine since then.  In the past few months, I've noticed that my lymph node on the right side of my neck has enlarged to like...epic proportions.  My left side is normal - i can feel it, and it is about the size of a pea, nothing out of the ordinary.  However, the lymph node on the right is probably approaching 4 centimeres in width.  It isn't visible, it does not seem to be growing 'out,' just ... getting wider.  It is hard, but not cemented.  It will move when pushed, but does not hurt at all.  

That, along with the incessant itching of my legs - to the point where I draw blood, do it in my sleep, and have caused more scratches and sores than a 20 year old female EVER wants to see on her legs - makes me wonder if perhaps it is something serious.  However, these things also seem to be symptoms of hyperthyroidism.  I also have somewhat shaky hands for the past few months.  I am not taking any medicine and have no other diagnosed illnesses.

Clearly, they are both fairly serious conditions, but hyperthyroidism seems to be the lesser of two evils.  Any thoughts?  I'm wanting to go with Occam's Razor, and believe that i am just being an extreme hypochondriac, making something out of nothing, and that it's probably just an infection.  However, i have not been 'sick' (no flu symptoms or common cold or anything) in the past few months, and the swollen node does not hurt at all.  It's just there.  Being large.  

Thoughts?  Guesses?  Misdiagnoses?  

I will say that I'm pretty sure everyone will tell me to ""go to the doctor ASAP"" but i'm NOT going to go to the doctor without insurance with the off chance that I am diagnosed with something, will then have a pre-existing condition, and have to deal with that mess.  Just saying :) 

But thanks ahead of time!

    Just curious if anyone had any noticeable symptoms when or before they were diagnosed? for the past 4 months I have been going round and round seeking someone who can diagnose my symptoms and my tests keep coming back normal, so after doing some research I have found that my symptoms may be an indication of Leukemia.

                Hey, I'm a 45 yr old female. Just before Easter this year I gotten strep so bad I went to the hospital after being in bed for 3 days. I was put of antibiotics and thought it was gone. A week later I was in pain again and seen my dr. She did a quick throat culture and yep, I had strep again. She gave me a routine exam where I explained to her all of the enlarged lymph nodes I have. It seemed like all of the gland in my neck were swollen, as well as under my chin, above and below my clavicle ( for sometime), my arm pit and throughout my arms and legs.  Some of the nodes I can feel and see, and others I can't. There seems to be a lump in my throat on the left side closet to my chin and when I touch it becomes painful, and makes a crunching sound when I move it. My dr. run standard blood tests checking thyroid function and cells levels and all came back normal. She made appt with and ENT for biopsy. 

My ENT appt is tomorrow, but since seeing my dr the nodes in my arm and legs seem to have grown and become more. It feels like there cutting off circulation when I bend them making it difficult to sleep. The nodes are so enlarged you can easily see them. 

Also, my dr. has perviously diagnosed me with chronic fatigue syndrome. I'm constantly tired, exhausted and worn out even after a full nights rest. sometimes ill wake up feeling like i haven't slept at all and other times i wake refreshed only to feel exhausted a few hours later. Does anyone out there have similar symptoms? I feel like a freak show and am extremely nervous about my appt and results.

                How long can a person have Hodgkins Lymphoma w/o knowing it? Or How long can a person survive having it w/o diagnosis. For instance, I heard there is some cancers a person can have for many years (like 10) before being diagnosed or knowing. 

I don't know what one woman had, what type of cancer, but my husband told me of a lady who went on vacation and she was fine (or so she said or didn't complain) and then she suddenly passed away while I'm vacation here she had stage 4 of some kind of cancer. She had apparently had it for a long time and didn't know it. 

Anyway, I'm having symptoms that mimic a type of Hodgkins and I am NOT paranoid. My doctor is on vacation, but she is working on answers. Cancer runs in my family big time. In addition to the symptoms of it, I have a swollen lymph node in my groin area that everyone is concerned about, but no one knows yet what is going on. I think she is going to send me to a hematologist. That's what I wanted my last doc to do, but he refused to send me. Instead he said he could run the tests, which were a regular cbc each time. I did have abnormal results but he did them every 2 weeks until they were somewhat normal. He did it due to my symptoms. I lost 38 pounds in 2 months then it ended up being 40 lbs. I have bad sweating at night time, occasionally a temp that is mostly at night, vomiting, nose bleeds, pain and much more. It's bad enough that I literally have head to foot issues (diagnosed problems). 

****Oh and I've Never been a drinker, but once in a blue moon I liked a drink. Discovered recently that I cannot tolerate any alcohol anymore. I tried a drink and I didn't even have it all and I had severe pain in my neck and shoulder. I thought it was just a coincidence. So a few weeks later I tried again and the same thing to the point of tears. My husband rubbing my neck and shoulder didn't help. Took a little while to go away.****

I thought it was no big deal. My husband says it is not normal and he thinks it is important to mention that to my doctor. I figure that there are probably a lot of ppl who get that. He says probably not that many people. So he made me just message my doctor about it. He said it might help her with what is going on with me. 

Any answers would be very much appreciated.

                   Back in early July I noticed a lump/knot in my neck cervical lymph node region the size of a nickle. The lump was rubbery, not very movable,and painless. I then started googling,and my research indicated possible lymphoma. So,not to jump to conclusions I took a wait,and watch approach for a few weeks. After 4 weeks I scheduled a appointment with my GP who scheduled me a appointment 4 weeks out Sept.11,because he is a busy doctor. I didn't wish to wait ,so I seen the APNP in same clinic. She noticed the lump ,and said it felt like a bean,and was somewhat fixed. She ordered blood tests including CRP,and ESR,and a neck ultrasound. The ultrasound was scheduled a week later. All blood work came back normal with the exception that the C reactive was 2.2 mg/dL. The ESR was 21 mm/hr. Doc was more concerned with the C reactive. So I waited,and the lymph node felt like it decreased in size slightly before the ultrasound.
      The ultrasound finding where:At the palpable abnormality site hyperechoic 1.8 x 1.2 x 0.6 cm lymph nodes noted with normal flow. No posterior acoustic shadowing is seen. No other abnormalities are seen.  Impression: Most probable reactive lymph node in the right neck. The APNP I seen said we will wait two weeks,then see what another C reactive test will show. That test showed 1.6 mg/dL. This is her message to me:

Your lab test is better, but still slightly elevated. I would suggest just having ENT take a look at that lymph node as well as your lab results and see if they feel it is benign or if it should be biopsied. I believe because it is getting smaller that it is nothing to be concerned about, but in light of the length of time you have had the enlarged lymph node and with the elevated lab value, I think it would be best just to have another opinion.

So I scheduled a appointment with a ENT for September 28th. The node is about the size of a pea,or small jelly bean,and seems fixed still.No pain. I also noticed another rubbery very tiny lump,or lymph node the size of a small shotgun pellet on my left side.That has been around same length of time,or longer,and hasn't grown either,and is not painful,but very fixed. The ultrasound did not detect that node even tho I mentioned it,and showed the radiologist its exact location. I haven't shown any of the B symptoms of lymphoma,or itchiness,or fatigue.I'm still wondering if I should worry about theses nodes. Any help would be appreciated.

Like 14 years ago i had a chicken pox virus , after i was cleared from it i felt a node on the back side of my right neck it was a pea sized node ..i asked the doc to check it he just gave antibiotics and asked me to forget about it might go away by it is own ...after all this time i used to feel it in my neck ...i was a heavy man very overweight guy ...a year ago i transformed from 125kg to 88 kg through sports and excercises ...after i lost my weight normally i started feeling the node in my neck more and also i have felt a new one next to it suddenly i was very affraid so i went to my gp for examination 

He asked me to do CBC test, ESR test, CRP test, kidney tests, livers tests, and ct scan for chest neck and abdomen with serum ... all came back normal only showing the two nodes in my neck one is 0.5mm and the second 0.7 mm 


He asked not to worry and when i travel back home and if i am still affraid i can do a small biopsy to ease my mind... plz can someone tell me do i still need to worry about it or just forget about the biopsy?

                I first noticed a small lump inside of my thigh close to my groin are that progressively became larger and darker in color and also painful. The lump remained for about 4 months when another showed up under my arm pit. Again, same scenario. Now I have another one that come up directly above the first one but grew fast and was severely painful with obviously a lot of fluid of some kind. It became so painful that I could barely walk so I believe may have been a stupid decision, but I cut it open to relieve the pain and a massive amount of puss and blood came out. Trying to get it checked but nothing back from the doctor yet to make appointment. I'm having to change doctors because I brought this up to him with the first one,he didn't seem to want to look, I told him about the second one and it was ignored so now there is a third one and I am not going back to that doctor for anything else. He is trying to treat my endometriosis and doesn't seem to care about this issue and he really doesn't even know what to do with my endometriosis either so that is another reason to change doctors.

However, it's been a few days and it seems to have gotten bigger. It's under the skin, doesn't cause much pain (generally painless, but sometimes if you press on it, it aches. Other times it randomly aches on its own), doesn't move, and seems hard (though I wouldn't describe it as rock hard). Does anyone have any idea what it could be? Of course when I google, it scares the daylight out of me because it would result as a malignant tumor. I'm hoping this isn't the case.

                I'll be succinct here..

-Bloating and visible distension going on for 6 months.  Pretty much constant, though it does wax and wane.
-Eating tends to make it worse, often with a seconds to a minute of consuming food. 
-Have experienced ongoing inability to get a deep breath.  Sometimes I can, sometimes I can't. Two CXR 4 months apart came up normal. PFTs normal. 
-Been to doctor for abdominal problems as well, CBC, colonoscopy, upper endoscopy all normal. Think it's IBS. I do have occasional constipation as well. 

The fact I get so bloated so quickly after eating makes me think it's not IBS. Combined with the breathing difficulties and I'm worried something sinister is going on. Would lymphoma cause the variable bloating as described above?  Would my stomach also experience varying degrees of distension with lymphoma?  It tends to go away when I lay flat btw.

Next step would be CT but my doctor is hesitant at this point.  Don't really know where else to turn right now. Very nervous and scared of what could be the cause.

                Hi,   49 year old male here.  No thyroid ( removed in 2012).   About 4 months ago I noticed that when i did pull ups at the gym i had something pushing inside my neck on the right side that was uncomfortable.   I had 2 sonograms and a ct scan that didn't show anything abnormal.   Then most recently the pain started to get worse in my neck.  Went in and had a sonogram   The report is in my photo center here,  but basically they found 3 items which they believe to be reactive lymph nodes.   

None of the three seem to have Fatty Hela.   the biggest one is 1.3 CM  x  .4   CM  X1.     I do not really have any other symptoms to speak of except the pain in my neck.    I don't have a thyroid so it is hard to sometimes distinguish not feeling well from feeling well because i usually don't feel great most of the time.

I don't have weight loss,  i don't have any fatigue.  The only real thing i can tell is i have these painful things in my neck ( 2 on the right,  one on the left which doesnt hurt).

The ENT says we can leave it alone,   do FNA  or take the two out and look at them.  I chose to have them removed.       Also i have been on 2 rounds of steroids and 3 antibiotics but none of it worked.

Impression 
2.   Subcentimeter Hypochoic nodules without clearly defined fatty hila.  These are not pathologic in size for lymph nodes but are abnormal in morphology and may represent reactive lymph nodes.    Continued clinical evaluation is advised.

Has anyone seen anything like this before?

thank you

                Hi there
After i lost my mother to cancer, i've been getting really hypochondircal and this maybe me getting anxious again, but anyways.
Couple days ago i noticed some kind of what i thought at that time was a vein sticking out of my bicep. I checked a bit more and it was oval shaped and tiny. So i thought it could be a lymph node. I checked other areas and found some tiny nodes in my groin area. They are not too big in both areas, about the size of a rice grain or maybe a small sunflower seed, so a bit less or a bit over a centimeter, most of them are a bit less. The only node that sticks out is the one in my bicep, others are invisible and i only found them by feeling my groin area. 
I am not sure if i have any other symptoms, i do itch a lot, but this may or may not be related to me just looking too much into that. I do get some sweats but it doesnt really rain with sweat, just some semi wet armpits. I do feel tired, but this is probably because i have a crazy sleep schedule and go to bed late, wake up early, do some things i have to do and sleep the rest of the day again. i also get some pains all over my body, like in my legs and in my back but im not sure if that is stress related or maybe in my head, but there it is. And today i woke up in the morning all sweaty in the wet bed and it wasnt hot outside or inside or anything. My day nap was okay i guess, i didnt sweat. But still not sure how will tomorrow turn out for me
I did have a blood test like in December at it was fine to abnormalities in the blood cells and the last time my weight was checked about a month ago, i didnt lose but gained some. 
So what i wanted to know is, when are the lymph nodes considered swollen? The info i found online is a bit conflicting, so i am not sure about anything. I've been told that the ""big nodes"" would be the size of a peanut M&M or so and for skinny people (which i am) some nodes may be easy to feel and find. How long do i have to watch for my nodes and what would be the solid reason to visit the doctor?
Thanks

                thanks for reading. for a little over two months now, i have been having a rash of symptoms that, based on all testing, are completely inexplicable. it started with some shortness of breath, which i attributed to anemia, only to find out i wasn't anemic. then came horrible fatigue. then memory and concentration problems. my foot broke while just walking. horrible dizziness and nausea, loss of appetite and almost a 10 pound weight loss in the last few weeks. now, i started having a horrible ache in my shoulder that i cannot attribute to anything. and i have been noticing a lot of hair loss. all of the symptoms are getting much worse... horrible weakness, fatigue from washing my hair, shortness of breath from just bending over this morning. 

i was not anemic when i was first tested a month ago, but on all of my subsequent tests, i have watched my numbers go down, down, down, until yesterday, i was finally confirmed as anemic. but i have been very anemic before and it was nothing like this. 

my wbc count is still within normal range, but it is getting towards the upper end of normal, and is 67% neutrophils as of yesterday. i recently found out that a drug i have been taking for almost 10 years, topamax, can artificially lower your wbc (sometimes significantly). 

my aunt died when she was my age of leukemia. this has also given me some pause.

has anyone else experienced anything like this or have any thoughts? i honestly don't know what to do next, because the doctors just keep doing the same tests and find nothing, so they say there is nothing wrong and treat me like i'm crazy. one even told me to lose weight while i was sitting there with my foot in an air cast, complaining of shortness of breath. i just feel like if i'm going to get any answers, i'm going to have to advocate for them myself.

thanks for reading my long post.

                Hi!  I have been having EXTREME shoulder pain for about one and a half months.  It is to the point I cannot raise my arm above my chest and I have to have help getting dressed.  I visited the ER in my town last night because the pain was so bad and I thought that it was may a dislocated shoulder.  (I have had zero injuries, bites or any of the other things listed)  The tech came in and did a sonogram (and the pressing on the armpit was excruciating) and the doctor came back and told me that I had several VERY swollen lymph nodes under my armpit on my right side.  He suggested I see my primary care physician right away.  I have an appointment with a new PCP on Wednesday morning.  Any ideas or suggestions of what this might be?  Also, anything that I can take over the counter that would help with the shoulder pain?

                I am an 18 year old female. I have had swollen Lymphnodes in my neck for maybe a year they are symmetrical I also found two under my jaw which are symmetrical. I'm very worried. I have visited 4/5 doctors and they said it is nothing and that I do not have cancer. A few weeks ago I had shortness of breath and a pain in my right ribs the A&E doctor said it was possibly pleurisy and prescribed me some pain relief and continued to tell me to stop worrying and that I do not have cancer. I have become very itchy and my mind is all over the place. I recently read online that individuals with lymphoma suffer from pleurisy. I also have been sneezing constantly and having itchy eyes. This is concerning me even more, as it could show my immune system is low. I have had a CBC and everything came back normal normal kidney and liver function but despite the doctors telling me I do not have lymphoma I still can't seem to shake the feeling that something is wrong...

                I'll try to make this as short as I can. I've been feeling off lately. I've had quite a few sore throats and even woke up with huge swollen tonsils about two months ago,  negative strep but still treated with antibiotics. Flash forward to last week. My left side of my neck became very sore,  all my lymph nodes are huge even the ones in my collar bone. So Saturday I starteddy feeling really run down. Sunday fever,  chills,  headache,  body ache nausea all started. Thinking maybe I had lymes disease I went to the ER. All my labs and all the tick borne ilnesses were negative. The only thing a little off was my wbc was a little low at 4.2 and my platelets were a little low at 120. On Tuesday I was still sick and felt like I had a sinus infection, went back to Dr,  my cbc then showed my white blood count was at 2.2 and my platelets were at 98. She wanted to repeat the tick borne illness tests. All negative again. So yesterday I went back my fever wasn't there but body aches and sinus issues. My cbc then showed my wbc to be at a 3 but my platelets continuing to drop to 87. I've never had abnormal blood work. So she gave me a script of antibiotics to try for a week and we'll repeat labs. If they are still bad then I'm going to a hemotologist. The fact that no doctor knows what is causing this makes me nervous. I dont get why they are waiting a week if the words leukemia have been mentioned. Today, my sinus issues feel better but for whatever reason,  my hips hurt so so bad. 

Anyways,  what did your labs look like?  I'm a single mom of 4 kids so it's hard not to get worked up worrying it could be cancer. Do you think I should ask to see a hemotologist right away?  If it was just the low wbc I wouldn't be so worried,  but I don't understand why my platelets are dropping too.

                Hi,
I am a 19 year old male.  I recently discovered when i raise my right arm, there is a 'lump'.  However, i cannot tell whether it is normal as in a muscle or bone from my shoulder area or indeed a lump.  I can see it when i raise my arm straight up, and it is kinda in the area where the arm meets the center of the armpit.  It is rather large, around a golf ball size.  On my left arm there is a very similar 'lump' but just a slight bit smaller.  Is this just a normal muscle or something, or is that not a normal thing for the armpit. It started feeling tender, but I keep getting nervous and poking it so I think that may be what is causing that.  Sorry if this was a little confusing.  Also I think this may have been here for quite a while, I just am nervous and cant remember and am just trying to make sure it is alright. 

Thanks for any help,
Matt

                Recently, ive been having a lot of health struggles for about almost 2 months. It started out with me lying in bed, in the beginning of June, I remember lying there and feeling a lump in my throat, like I could swallow. I rushed to the ER, they said it was my uvula and that it was swollen (it really wasn't) and sent me off with some medicine. I went to the ER 3 days after that, and they tested me and also claimed it was my ""swollen uvula"". But, they also did a chest and throat x-ray, a swab of my throat, and some blood work, all came back fine. I then attended summer school, and had frequent panic attacks or ""high anxiety"" ever since. Then, I had went to a clinic (Early July) and they also said the same thing, they prescribed me claritin (didn't solve swallowing issue as I had no swollen uvula.) Later, (around the 10th of July) I got sick, I came down with green/yellow mucus, which lasted only 3 days. After a little while after the green mucus had stopped, I noticed I had a sore throat and my neck swelled up, my lymph nodes became palpable. Now, this is when I started to google my symptoms, from this day forward my ""high anxiety"" came with crying. A little after this, (last week) I went to an ENT specialist who felt my nodes and thought nothing of them, he thought they were no problem at all and told me how a sore throat can drain to sides of the neck, he also looked down my throat with a tube and found nothing of concern, as well as feeling my neck, he said he wants to see me back in 6 weeks and that it was all in my head. I felt relieved for about a day.. until I started searching again.... Now, fast forward a couple days, to Sunday (2 days before the intial post of this post), I noticed that my arms were aching and my legs were tingling (without pins and needles), and weak, and it also felt like they were on fire, along with this my hip was ""the source"" ( or aching most) of the aching. My arms still ache and it feels like the shoulders are the ""source"" of the aching. Along with this, I get little muscle twitches and ticks all over my body, usually they're concentrated in my legs and arms (the twitching is.) as well as my joints popping. Along with all this, it feels like im falling sometimes or that my head goes light, along with a feeling of nervousness in my chest (hard to explain. I also got constipated and hit with diarrhea, with a bit of swelling (not visible, but I can feel it). My throat is still sore and it still feels one side of my nose is stuffed and that there's mucus in my chest/throat (although its not green/yellow, its white or foamy, but definitely thick). My eyes also feel a little strained sometimes, everyone says these symptoms come from anxiety (minus the whole lymph node and sore throat thing), but im so fearful of having lymphoma, lukemia, thyroid cancer, or any form of cancer!! I fear that all these symptoms are really not anxiety, and that im dying or something, I just want reassurance that this will all end and i'll get my life back, but that feels so..afar.. I thank you reader that you've gotten this far. Please respond, and God bless you.

P.S: My groin kinda hurts (private parts (im male so take a guess what does)), my parents are convinced its anxiety, and refuse to take me to any more doctors.
I also lost my appetite and can feel my stomach growling or having that ""hungry feeling"" even after I eat. My muscles get like this even when im not hyperventilating, I trained myself to do that less.

                Since April of 2016, my friend pointed out a very small bump at the bottom of my neck, a bit below my thyroid. it was maybe 5mm, the size of a BB. I had known about this a few months before it was pointed out, I just didn't think much of it at all. Then a few months later in October, it was still there (hadn't grown in size), but I noticed another bump on my chin, maybe a cm in size or so. I don't know if it has been there for a while or if it just appeared in October. I also have very small lymph nodes (less than 3 mms maybe) under my chin, like one or two. They seem kinda loose, as in I can push them around, they're painless, and I feel completely healthy. I have not visited a doctor yet but I should be soon hopefully, should I be at all concerned about these? If it helps, I'm male and 14.

                I know I need to consult a Dr., but last time I paid $100 to be treated rudely and thrown some antibiotics. 

Anyway, the lymph node under my right ear/ jawline became swollen last August, I went to the Dr. and had the previously described experience and was diagnosed with an ear infection. However, the lymph node has not significantly decreased in size nearly a year later. It was hard and flesh colored for 10 months, although some of the soreness subsided. However, last week it become sore again and I noticed that it looks like there is blood in the center of it. It is now squishy and very sore, and I feel a slight onset of my ear infection again, is that normal behavior for a lymph node? Should the same one become inflamed over and over? 

Thanks in advance.

                Okay so this has started about a month ago. The pain is felt in my groin on the left side. Its in the pubic bone area and the pain is in between the pubic mound and thigh. That area in between them. It just comes and goes. Its a pulsing dull pain when it happens but doesn't happen for long. I tried checking for lymph nodes but idk what I'm checking for tbh. Could it just be pubic bone inflammation? The bone has been tender to press down on. But I'm worried if it could be something else. I've already been diagnosed with GAD so this isn't making my mental health any better because of the worrying that its cancer or something else

                Hello! Late night anxiety and I'm losing sleep over this. I'm a 25 year old girl, normal weight, training for a marathon, not a perfect diet but definitely better than average. Gluten free because I have an allergy.

A little under three years ago, I noticed what I'm now am pretty sure is a swollen lymph node in my groin area (where my leg attaches, far away enough from my front that I have difficult looking at it. I have tiny hands, and it's always been the size of my fingertip, so about .5 inches or slightly smaller. It is hard but not super hard, I wouldn't say that I can move it around but it's not stiff, I can kind of sort of move it (not from the spot it's in but I can push it back and forth and it wiggles, it's not rigid). It's the same color as my skin, and it doesn't hurt. Part of me is not worried because I'm fairly certain it hasn't grown, but part of me is totally freaking out because what if it's slow-growing lymphoma that I've just left undiagnosed for almost three years.

I'm going to call the doctor tomorrow, but any advice while I'm waiting for an appointment would be greatly appreciated because I'm totally bugging out.

                     Has anyone else had good luck with megadoses of vitamin C for your CLL?
     Five years ago I was diagnosed with CLL and began my wait and watch routine. About ten months ago there were signs of a more rapid rate of increase in WBC and signs of near anemic drop in HGB, enough that oncologist warned me that chemotherapy would soon be called for. I was showing symptoms of enlarged lymp glands under my arms and a lack of stamina or energy. 
     At that point I began taking 2,000 to 4,000 mg of vitamin C per day. On my next visit my WBC had dropped and my HGB seemed to be stabilizing. My oncologist seemed surprized but refused to admit that maybe the vitamin C was helping. He wanted me to come back in three months.
I was feeling better and told him that I was going to take a long vacation and not worry about my CLL for a few months. During that period I generally took 4,000 mg vitamin C. 
    Two weeks before my 10-18-07 doctor visit I was taking 8,000 mg of vitamin C. My lymph glands under my arms had enlarged significantly, but I was feeling surprizingly good. In five months my WBC had increased from 79 to only 103 , and my HGB count had remained nearly constant if not improved slightly, moving from 11.3 to 11.6. My oncologist seems to be scratching his head yet about vitamin C, but agrees that we can hold off on the chemo for now. Great news to me!
    Was it the vitamin C or the prayer chain at church?
    Whatever, prayers are still being said and I have now started taking 10,000 mg (ten grams) of vitamin C daily. My hero, double Nobel prize winner, chemist, Linus Pauling, took ten grams of vitamin C throughout his adult life and lived to age 93, so it surely won't hurt me. I'm 77.

                I have been feeling different for the past 4 or 5 months. It started with the feeling of fatigue and constent cold. Then i discoverd a lining of swollen lymph nodes under my jaw line (left side),  above my adams apple, groin, a large lump above my left collar bone and my lower left trachea which I feel is crushing my windpipe and giving me inability to catch a breath of air, the chronic shortness of breath is a major symptom. I went to the doctor and they took blood samples that came back clear. My symptoms got worse ( shortness of breath, chest pain, and growing lymph nodes) she performs a ultra sound and the result came back "" remarkable with no enlarge lymph nodes"" which made me very aggitated because they are obviously sticking out of my neck, anyone with the ability to feel will understand my lymph nodes are not normal what so ever. I have had brittle asthma my entire life and spent my first 2 years in the hospital. I know my asthma symptoms and this is not asthma, and i am certain. These people gave me 6 nebulizer treatment and there was no change in my shortness of breath (obviously) because if that would have helped i would have never went to the damn hospital and waste my time and money in the first place. Anyway after the 6 treatments nothing change and they still managed to send me home with asthma difficulties. I said whatever and made an appointment the next day. They said the same thing like i have asthma and anxiety but i choose to go in for a ct scan. Everything came back normal. The sympoms are only getting worse, should i do something else about this?

                Since 2015, I've undergone numerous tests because a CBC indicated eosinophilia and neutropenia 

Eos highest 17%, lowest 8.

They've tested me for every parasite, allergy, virus, Ct scans, autoimmune disease etc. all good.

They determined the eosinophilia was idiopathic since a diffenative cause could not be found

Thanksgiving 2016, a severe sore throats woke me at 2am. I lost my voice completely for 2 weeks. A strep test was done and negative but I was given antibiotics to kill whatever was causing the sore throat.

2 weeks later I developed bronchitis. And another round of antibiotics 

A few weeks from that, I came down with what I thought was the flu
Severe bone and joint pain. Especially in my hips and upper leg. Fever as high as 102. I went to the doc, flu test was negative. But they did a CBC this time. Eosinophilia again and neutropenia. This led tho another round of testing just like I went thru in 2015. Nothing could be determined 
The hematologist said again idiopathic 
But, this time I tested positive for ANA. 
Which sent me to rheumatology 

Last Wednesday was my follow up
There were no indications of any autoimmune disorder so I was told all clear and good 

However
Friday afternoon the nurse called and left a message
They had just received lab results from the Mayo Clinic and to call her Monday morning to discuss the results with me.

I'm in a panic mode. 
Is there a possibility this could be leukemia? 

How long has it taken others to get a diagnosis?

What has been others experience of testing and symptoms?

Thank you for your help

                Hi, my wife is in the Philippines and I am getting her a spouse visa to come to my country in Europe, this process could take two or three months.

She has noticed a growth on her lymph node, like a 'ball', near to her front jawline and been for medical advice. It is not responding to antibiotics after two weeks. She has had an X-ray with no obvious problems visible and an ultrasound scan that came back with:

There is approximately 14.8 x 10.7 x 5.5 mm well-defined complex focus in the submental region. No significant internal vascularity is detected. 

Both thyroid lobes are normal in contour, echo pattern and dimensions. No definite focal solid nor cystic nodule is detected.

Isthmus is not thickened.

Trachea is in the midline.

COMMENT

Complex submental structure wherein lymph node is considered.

--

She has been advised to have a surgical procedure, I am not sure if this would be to remove the growth or the whole node.

The problem I have is deciding whether it better for her to have this procedure urgently in the Philippines, or waiting to join me in my country and have more extensive investigations and treatment here, where the standard of healthcare is generally far better. I am not sure if the hospital that she has been attending has a CT scanner so there is probably a limit to what they can understand before operating.

I understand that cancers come into a lymph node from elsewhere in the body, but can a cancer spread from a lymph node?

On balance I am taking the view that it is safer for her to have the surgical procedure as a priority in the Philippines, this has the downside that we will probably not learn enough the reasons behind it.

What is your estimation of the risk in this instance? Any advice appreciated.

                Hi, I had some recent blood work done. It was a full CBC, and everything was normal, except for ""Immature Granulocytes Absolute"". The Normal range is 0.00 to 0.01, and mine was 0.02. I had no infections at the time the blood work was taken. My family doctor said not to worry, but I am concerned this could mean leukemia. Can anyone tell me if this is normal among people with no infection?

                I have had a lump in my groin about 2 cm big for at least 7 weeks I was showering when I noticed it and it isn't painful, so completely unsure how long I have actually had it. I went to Dr and he couldn't find it while I was laying down when I stood up he could feel it. He said it was a swollen lymph node and that if it doesn't go away in another 6 weeks to call him and he will set me up with a surgeon for a needle biopsy. Needless to say I am freaking out because my father had lymphoma, but my question is if the lump cant be felt while laying down isn't that more typical of a hernia not a swollen gland? I am a 33 year old female that had 2 pregnancies in the last 2 years if that matters. All answers appreciated, I suffer from severe health anxiety and just trying to ease my mind. Thank you

                Just a quick question.  I had a routine physical a few weeks back. Had all the normal blood work done.  Well I have a less than normal WBC count I guess.  Is a level of 3.8 even a concern? He wants me to re-test in a couple weeks.  I have lost 26 lbs in the last six months without trying...no diet or exercise...just not as big of an appetite as before.  I havn't been this size/weight since highschool.  (which Im quite pleased with actually!...)  I know back in July I was in the ER for abdominal pain (I have uterine fibroids...lots of them) and they tested my count then and it was normal...7 something.  The only other thing to mention is how tired I am all the time. Granted I have three little kiddo's to take care of (17 mo, 4 and 7).  But it's the kind of tired that I felt in my first trimester of all pregnancy's (which I KNOW for a fact that isn't the cause this time).  Have to nap during the day etc..  Oh, and we thought maybe I could be anemic from the extra bleeding from the fibroids...but that part of the blood test was normal..go figure, since that would of easily explained everything.  

Anyway, whenever I type in white blood cells...words like leukemia come up so that's why Im posting here...I could be totally off base though...

Any thoughts?

                We went in for testing because we thought she might have a seafood allergy. She had developed a rash while on spring break. The tryptase level came back at 18 and she is not allergic to seafood. 
The rash went away. She has had terrible headaches for a couple years. She dances 4 days a week and she gets seriously red faced after a few minutes. Never thought anything of it. She has sensitive skin. If she gets a mosquito bite, she gets a huge welt. The doc says we need to wait 4 weeks for another blood test. Just hard to wait...

                Hi there, ever since the beginning of 2016 I have had enlarged lymph glands under my left armpit. I can feel pretty much all of them under there and I have had a doctor feel them and he said that they aren't worrisome and that I'm a hypochondriac. In that time from January of 2016 the lymph nodes have not grown or changed, however in that time there have been a few times where I have woken up soaked in sweat. And most recently which has made me being to worry more than anything about lymphoma again is that I've now found a new lymph glands under my right armpit and the most alarming thing is that I can't stop itching at night time like I literally get so itchy at night. I'm a 20 year old boy and I'm convinced this has to be lymphoma I'm having all the tell tale signs but I don't think doctors will take it seriously as they say all bloods are fine and they don't think the glands are worrying. I also get dizzy quite often during the day. I have however never lost weight in fact, I've put on 5 pounds since the start of 2017. Does anyone else think I could have lymphoma? I'm so scared

                29 year old here. In September 2016, I had some sort of throat/sinus infection and went to Dr. who noticed a swollen lymph node in neck. I was sent for an ultrasound in October 2016 which revealed some enlarged nodes with the largest being 1.6cm. All blood work was normal at the time. Normal chest X-ray. Sinus issues continued off and on. A followup ultrasound in February 2017 showed that some nodes had resolved while the largest was now 1.9cm. I was referred to as ENT who is the head of surgery in his department and deals with many cancer cases. He stated that the node did not raise any flags during palpated exam but suggested an FNA for reassurance. FNA in March 2017 returned benign results. Followup ultrasound in May 2017 shows a single stable cervical node at 1.9/2.0cm. My ENT states that given my blood work and FNA results, he considers this to be a benign reactive node and plans a followup in six months. I have no other symptoms except for some random tenderness in the area which seems to coincide with my allergies and sinus issues. Should I seek a second opinion or any additional test?

                So about 9 months ago i visited the GP about my persistent tiredness and being run down. Blood tests were taken and came back normal. I visited last week due to a hard pea moveable lump just above my collarbone. One doctor seemed concerned, the other said it was normal. They asked about night sweats and itching, me being me said occasionally but nothing consistent. Actually, i have a patch on my back which becomes really itchy, especially in the shower and i wake up sweating every morning. Not drenched in sweat though. I also developed a pain in my elbow back in february which hasnt improved.  Ive noticed lumps by my pelvis, which i mentioned on my first gp visit, she said it felt like muscle wall however it now feels much bigger.

Im 32.

Getting in with our gp is near impossible and i dont want to waste anyones time.  Do you think i need to go back? 

I know its all probably a coincidence, but my daughter relies on me and if it is anything nasty, i dont want to leave it.

Thanks

                HI Ken, in January I discovered 2 lumps under my right armpit. I went to my Dr who suggested an ultrasound. I had that done in March, and the radiologist told.me they looked.like reactive nodes. When I HD my follow up with my gp she said the size was not concerning (small) and showed fatty hilum, however she wanted me to come back in 3 months. She said they most likely would not be palpable.  It's 2 months later and they are still palpable and I have recently started having low grade fevers. Thoughts? ? Thank you so much. Btw, I'm 32 female good shape

                Hi there I've asked a question here before about my worries with lymphoma. Basically since December of 2015 I have been able to feel quite a few lymph glands under my left armpit. I can feel about 4. Since I first found them they have never grown in size or changed and I kinda feel like they appeared over night. I only felt them because there was a pain under that armpit so when I felt around that's when they came to my notice. So as I said theyve never grown in size. I've been to my doctor and let him feel them but he said they didn't feel worrisome to him and that I should move on. For the most part I have but I can always still feel them and I have a multitude of symptoms that appear sometimes like occasionally having a really bad night sweat where I'm really drenched in sweat but when this does happen and I awake I'm always fully under my cover so almost no heat is escaping. And also this is an occasional thing I dont have these night sweats happening reccuringly. Another thing is that I sometimes get itchy but I more feel that happens when I'm thinking about being itchy so I can't help it. There's times where I've been ridiculously run down lately almost feel anemic and I'm run out of breath when I'm not even exerting myself. I do have a problem where I'm celiac though so I can never tell if it's just that because having celiac is a daily struggle anyway! I may have been told on this that my nodes under my armpit would have grown over time but then I've read about indolent lymphomas or something and how they can take time to start causing troubles but I haven't really seen any cases of this type in someone of my age. I'll ask again, since it's been a year and a half since these nodes appeared and since they've not grown would that suggest something else? I've had pains and burning sensations on the left side of my body since I was 18 so could be reactive to this? And also has anyone heard of someone having an indolent lymphoma in a 20 year old boy?

                I'm 23 yrs. old. I noticed this lump, probably a size of a marble, just below my left ear a year and a half ago but it didn't bother me at first. It's not actually obvious if I face in front of a mirror. I cannot feel the lump if I'll just tap my fingers on my skin or push it softly. I still have to push my finger further to feel the lump. It's hard, fixed and painless. Now, I'm really worried because I checked it again and it's still there! I checked my right ear if there's a lump but there's none. I don't think its size changed but it is still hard, fixed and painless. I checked the inside of my mouth if something strange is growing in there but its fine. I googled it based on my description and the results in the internet are really frightening. I'm starting to panic, and feel scared and depressed. I'm not sure if it's a lymph node or something else. I tried to calm myself but everything in the internet is not comforting.

                Since many years ago (about 15) I have noticed palpable lymph nodes on the posterior triangle, on both sides of my neck, one week ago I felt a little pain (it only lasted for some hours) on the right side of my neck, and noticed it was swollen, it's clearly visible specially if I turn my neck towards the opposite direction, about 2 cm in diameter, it feels rubbery, no redness on skin, no pain at all, I don't feel like it moves at all, maybe bend a little but no displacement while touching it. About 4 days later I noticed a small lump, maybe less than a cm, in what I believe is called the ""upper jugular"" area, I think it corresponds to level 2 lymph nodes, it feels hard, unmovable and clearly visible if I look upwards (towards ceiling).

What could be the cause?

I'm 30 years old, have smoked a pack a day for about 15 years, social drinker.
Don't know if relevant but about a year ago I started losing weight (unintentionally), followed after by lack of appetite.  I also sleep 12 hours a day.  But this last symptoms could be due to depression (not sure if I have that, but I do show a lot of signs)

Thank you for your time.

                I'm a 37 year old and I just had a complete blood workup done a week ago due to ongoing muscle and joint pain I've been experiencing for quite a while. The blood work was essentially normal except for slightly elevated triglycerides and cholesterol, but what really stood out was that my B12 level was elevated at 1299. I believe the normal range is 200-900. I went online to look for possible causes for elevated B12 levels in the blood, and most of the information I found was related to B12 deficiencies. The small bit of information I found regarding elevated B12 stated that it could be associated with some forms of leukemia. My doctor did send me a letter interpreting the blood results, and he stated that I do not need any further testing. I do have an appointment to see him next week to discuss things, but I don't know whether or not to push for more testing since he doesn't seem too concerned. Does anyone have experience with elevated B12 levels? If so, does anyone know if the elevated B12 levels associated with leukemia are drastically higher than the normal lab range? Or is the 1299 I had on my test considered very high. I would greatly appreciate any feedback. This has me really worried. Thank you.

                Hey everyone, 
I came on this forum because I've been having some stomach issues lately and I'm not getting any answers.  So, back in September I got a fecal occult blood test done, which came back positive.  A blood test also showed slight anemia.  My GI ordered a colonoscopy with biopsies, all which were negative.  I was okay for a while, but aroud two months ago I started to feel run down.  I had another blood test which showed anemia again, and I was asked to take multivitamins with iron.  This didn't help much, and last month I got another stool test done which was negative, but the blood tests still showed anemia despite the vitamins.  I had another colonoscopy just a few days ago, but it was clear again except for one tiny internal hemorrhoid. 
My question is, despite the negative colonoscopy, I still feel like something is going on and I'm still bleeding from somewhere.   My hemoglobin and ferretin continue to go down, and I know that stool tests don't show blood all the time.  I'm just SO frustrated because I continue to feel really tired and sick all the time, and both my parents and GI seem at a loss for what else to do.  I've had 2 colonoscopies, 1 endoscopy, 1 abdominal ultrasound, 1 transabdominal ultrasound, a Meckel diverticulum scan, ova and parasite stool tests, and a calprotectin test, all which came back negative.  I just don't know what to do because I feel like something is wrong but every test is clear.  I also have a skew of other bowel issues, like increased bowel movements (I used to go once a day, I started going 3-4 times a day since August), excessive gas, and a feeling of incomplete evacuation.  I also lost some weight but it's currently stable.
My most recent blood test showed a PT of 14.7 (range is 11.8-13.5) an INR of 1.2 and a PTT of 40.1 (range is 23.8-35.8).  My platelets are within range, and I have a slightly elevated bilirubin of 1.3 (<1.1 is normal).  I am currently on vitamin K, but it doesn't seem to be helping much, which leads me to believe something else is going on.

user_20130799,Poolaf,/posts/Leukemia-and-Lymphoma-/Persistent-lymph-nodes-all-over-body/show/2969274,Persistent lymph nodes all over body,"
                Hello, I am a 14 year old male with lymph nodes for roughly 3 years. I can vaguely remember the time where I felt my first node pop up near the back of my neck when I was 11 or 12. During that time I had no clue what a lymph node was and why there was this mysterious bump on the back of my neck. Slowly, as time progressed, more nodes began to propagate throughout my body to the point where I got really anxious. As of right now, I have nodes pretty much everywhere, neck, back of head, ears, under the collar bone, armpit, and groin. I have 4 on the back of my head, probably 6 around my neck, some near my ears, 4-5 under my jaw, 3-4 under my collar bone, 1 under my armpit, and about 5 around my groin. I think it began with the node on the back of my head and slowly, it started to grow all over my body. These nodes are painless and moveable that range from 1cm to 1 1/2cm and never grown bigger or smaller. I've been to probably four doctors (two of them were specialists) and they all assured me that it was normal, but I can't really wrap my brain around it. They couldn't identify the cause of these lymph nodes, but they did order blood tests and a chest x-ray which all came back normal. However, one of these tests was in 2016, which tested positive for EBV, but I don't think that's the cause of my swelling that's started late 2013. I've heard that you can't diagnose lymphoma with just a blood test, you have to get a biopsy done. I asked the oncologist for a biopsy, but she refused and said that the surgeon wouldn't operate on those nodes. Well now it's 2017, about 7 months since my last checkup and I'm still in paranoia. If only they could find the roots to the cause of these lymph nodes, I would probably be less stressed out. The only symptom I have is painless nodes which makes me believe it's one of those really slow growing lymphomas. Any others out there with similar symptoms? 

Feedback would greatly be appreciated.

(Also, no one in our family has been diagnosed with lymphoma before)

                I've had a palpable lymph node in my neck for nearly 2 years that I know about. As far as I can tell by feeling it, there has been no growth. It's on the right side towards the back at my hairline. I had an ultrasound done 1.5 years after discovering it and all it says is that it looks like a lymph node and gave the size at 1x0.9x0.4 cm. I'm reading around the net and keep reading about round not being good and oval being good. But it seems mine is oval and good axis ratio in one direction, but round in the other. Is that abnormal shape?

It's hard to tell if it's fixed or not and if it's hard or not. It's definitely not freely moveable. It's embedded in other tissue and so it doesn't move around, but I can't tell if it's attached to other tissue or just sunken down among it. When I press on it to feel if it's hard, it sinks into my neck. It can't be grabbed as not enough of the node is above the surface. It's not visible and can't be felt when running my hand over it without applying pressure. But is easily felt as soon as I apply any pressure.

                I have a very hard, swollen, fixed lymph node under my ear. Its been this way for about 6 months. I finally got enough nerve to go to my PCP. His words we not very encouraging. He said with what he felt best case scenario was a ""raging infection somewhere inside my body. Worse case is Lymphoma. The node is not painful and the one in the same spot on the opposite side is also hard and fixed but only fingertip sized, whereas the other is about the size of a quarter. I has a CBC done yesterday and all reading we within normal limits. My RBC was on the lowest side of normal and my WBC is 6.8. That would lead me to think we could rule out infection. I have had a low grade constant fever for approximately 3 months, intense night sweats. Sometimes I have to change clothes in the middle of the night. I am also very  fatigued all the time and we have a very busy life so I constantly have something I have to do and it takes everything I have some days just to function. I will be seeing a surgeon in 4 days, but I am very apprehensive and was just wondering if anyone has an opinion or similar experience. I am a 35yr old female and have always been in pretty good health.

                I am 21 years old and a health female. Recently I've started to have major anxiety about my health. My wisdom teeth are giving me problems and my check is swollen as well as my sternocleidomastoid muscle on the right side where my impacted tooth is. A couple days ago I also noticed a pea sized lymph node on the posterior cervical. It doesn't hurt at all and unless I tilt my head to the side and feel it or dig into my neck to feel it when my neck is straight I don't feel it. I am not sure if I should worry. I don't know if many it's from my wisdom tooth or even from a cold I had about a week and a half ago. I don't know if I've had this and now since I'm having health anxiety and looking for any possible thing now I'm finding problems.

I am 23 years old and there has been a lymph node in my neck just below the jaw line that has been enlarged for months or maybe even longer. It is really worrying me. It seemed to have went down a bit a few weeks ago but now it's back to it's enlarged size. A while ago, I got an ultrasound on the enlarged node and they said it didn't look too concerning. They said that my body just might be fighting an infection that I don't know about. Could an ultrasound pick up cancer if it was abnormal? I am freaking out because what if it is cancer and it's been a while now and the lymph node is still enlarged. What infection can my body possibly be fighting for this long? I have recently noticed that while I'm working, the lymph node seems to shrink down a lot but when I go back home, later on I feel it enlarged again. Can this be due to allergies? I am allergic to dandruff from cats and dogs and I have 3 cats and 1 dog. I aslo haven't been sick recently. I actually haven't been sick in years. I believe I have  a strong immune system. I do have a bit of a cough though and I constantly have a stuffed up nose because I was recently diagnosed with a slight deviated septum and polyps plus blockage in the nose. I always have to breathe through my mouth. I was put on steroids and nasal spray and my nose cleared up a bit but the lymph node in my neck still hasn't shrunk. Only when I'm at work it seems to shrink. I also have asthma and I've had it since I was a child. Sometimes in the area, my neck feels a bit tight and is irritating and a bit sore. Sometimes my whole neck aches as well. Idk if I'm over paranoid or what but I recently noticed a small lump on the lower back of my neck like it could be another node enlarging. Idk what is going on in my body and what is causing this. Can it be the constant weather changes? It has been going from warm to freezing weather in a matter of days. My nose tends to get stuffed up during the day too. I just hope this is nothing seriously life threatening. A response would be appreciated to help ease my mind.

                So I have had this swollen lump on the left side of my neck for 3 months now. It is hard and fixed, and relatively no pain. It is located right under my ear. 
I initially went into a walk in clinic. I was tests for mono and strep throat. I came back positive for strep throat. I was treated with antibiotics and a steroid. I had no symptoms of strep throat. The medication did nothing for the swollen mass or lymph node... whatever it is. 
A few weeks later I made an appointment with a physician. He sent me to have a blood test, x-ray and CT scan. Then he referred me to see an ENT. 
Meanwhile, I have been having bad headaches, earaches and shortness of breath. Lymph node still wasn't causing in pain in that area however I would get a sharp pain in the back of my head. 
The blood test came back normal. I read that the X-ray said that my lungs were inflated, but the DR never discussed this with me. I also read that the CT said atrophy of the submadibular gland, but all the DR said was that the CT scan was normal besides the mass. He thinks it is either an infected lymph gland or cysts. 
He put me on medication to take for two weeks and said that if it doesn't go down then I will need surgery. It's been a week and a half and it hasn't gone down. I all of the sudden began to have horrible pain where the lymph node is. So I called him and they switched my medication. Now, it is not as sore but it is still the same size. 
Not sure if I should be concerned or not. What do you think?

                Hi, 
I don't know if I have cause to be concerned but I saw my gastroenterologist about 6 months ago for a number of symptoms (heartburn, etc) and he ordered a ton of blood tests -- the results showed that my AFP tumour marker was 10.1. I repeated the blood tests about 3 months ago and just found out via his secretary that my level is pretty much the same (don't know if it is exactly the same or a bit higher or lower) and he is referring me to a hematologist. I don't know if this is relevant but my WBC count was also elevated on both tests (around 12.2) and my ferritin is low. I'm a 45 yr old female and in otherwise good health.
I've googled what this might mean and I've seen lymphoma and leukemia come up quite frequently. I should note that another symptom I've been having for many months now is dizziness/lightheadedness and, as usual, I'm always tired, but my family doctor chalked all of this up to being ""probably just anxiety"". All my immunoglobin & hepatitis tests were fine as were all my other liver function tests (the only other things that were off some things in my CBC but he didn't seem to focus on these). 
The fact that he is bothering to refer me thinks there must be some cause for concern & I'm wondering if anyone here has had similar AFP levels that turned out to be cancer? Also, would 10.1 be considered a mild elevation? Has anyone had this and it turned out to be no big deal?
Thanks very much for any & all input,
Shari

                Hi there. 
I haven't been feeling well since January 1st. I have a lot of speculated problems and ideas but nothing has been really confirmed, this includes lymphoma.
When this first started my WBC was very low, but apparently, it's gone up (got the call today after having blood work at the beginning of the week). I haven't been shown the exact numbers or any other results from my blood work. While my WBC seems to be ""improving"" my symptoms are getting worse.
Even though my blood work seems fairly ""normal"", is it possible to still have lymphoma? Is it possible to change from low to normal and still be lymphoma? I would really like to see what you all think.

I have a swollen lymph node in my groin/tummy area which has become more tender and painful. This ""lump"" was noticed by a doctor at the hospital and I also think my neck lymph nodes are slightly enlarged, but not considerably. 
lymph nodes in my neck, also a lump under my breast. 

The symptoms are;
Unexplained weight loss  (13% + of body weight in one month)
Trouble breathing (My oxygen levels were normal at the hospital, but it can feel like I'm not getting enough air especially after walking.
Chills / sweats / fever
Weak  (I was turning off my phone and holding down the button and the exertion caused my hands to shake uncontrollably. )
Achy muscles, especially in my inner arm and legs
Trouble walking
Dizziness
Extreme stomach/hip/abdomen pain. I had an ultrasound and it was extremely painful, I cried.
Headaches 
Have trouble going to bed but then have trouble getting out of bed, always tired. 
Incredibly itchy, this is a new and very annoying symptom.
I think I'm pooping/peeing blood as well, I found some blood in the toilet earlier today, I do have pictures but I'll only share them if it's relevant.
Painful period cramps (don't know if this is relevant)


I have had a pelvic/ab external ultrasound but that came normal, and a pelvic/ab xray which came back normal. I also had a back xray (a chiropractor recommended this). It showed subluxations in my neck and lower spine, the chiropractor was ""90% sure this was my problem"" and the cost for the treatment was very expensive.
I do have a CT coming up, but no chest xrays or biopsy.

I'm wondering if it's possible to have a normal-ish WBC and still have lymphoma, or if it's happened to you.

                About 1.5 years ago, I noticed a lymph node under the corner of my jaw about 1-1.5cm large, it is moveable. I went to the doctor who said I shouldn't worry about it. (I do suffer from chronic tonsil stones, though the worse effected tonsil is on the opposite side to the enlarged lymph node) However 2 years later, and it is still there (The exact same size and everything - I'm guessing the fact it has not grown is a good thing?). 

Though around the same time, I went to the dentist, who noticed that I had bad decay behind one of my pre-molars on the same side as the lymph node. He took away as much of the decay as possible, but said ""We're getting very close to the root/nerve now, and there is still some decay left"", so he offered root canal, or trying to put an antibiotic cream on the inside of the tooth and fill it with a filling. 

It has been a number of months since the dentist, and the tooth is still very very painful when exposed to cold. Do you think that perhaps the swollen lymph node is due to the tooth, and that the original procedure didn't work, and thats why the lymph node is still swollen?

Also, on a side note, is it also possible that even though my left tonsil is more effected with tonsil stones, that a lymph node on the right hand side of my jaw would be enlarged as a result and not the left one? Or would it effect the lymph node on the same side as the tonsil only?

                My son came home over a week ago with a lymph node under his jaw. Then next day, there was one on the other side, and one under his chin. I took him to the doctor, he's 15 by the way. Doctor was suspect it was a reaction to his braces irritating the jaw. Ortho took his braces off, and gave him invisiline just to be sure. He did X-rays, no infections. No fever. No response to antibiotics. No aching, nothing except massively swelling lymph nodes, super sore to the touch. Of course I'm thinking the worst, like lymphoma. Another physician tells me this just isn't how cancer presents. Blood work all came back normal. Now we are waiting to see the ENT in a few days. His neck reminds me of a hamster with food packed in its jaws. I started thinking, this looks like mumps back from the photos I remember seeing in undergrad. However he's been vaccinated, but there is an overpopulation at his school by 1500 kids. I'm scared. He's been vaccinated but I know that mumps vaccination is only about 78percent. I'm just wondering, could this be mumps? I've not slept well, worried sick. Even the tissue up on his jaw towards his side burns had inflammation. We had the test for mumps done yesterday. It's still not back. Someone please tell me this is probably mumps or does it look like we're looking at something much worse.

                I'm 41, male, and about 1 month ago I was purposely checking for lymph nodes for no reason other than a periodic check much like others do for other conditions. Well I was able to feel what I belive to be a left supraclavicular node if I gently pressed against the skin above the clavicle and dragged the fingers down to the clavicle. At that point a small node would pop out of the way of my fingers and the clavicle. It is not painful. It's not hard and it's not fixed. I feel like it's larger than 1 cm, but I realize that the overlying tissue might magnify the size. I went to my internist about a week after finding it and he had a difficult time palpating it and suggested we just follow up in a few weeks. I'm a fairly anxious person and the last few days have not been without worry. When I research left supraclavicular nodes the information all refer to abdominal processes like cancer or lymphoma. The research, though, only mentions the nodes in those conditions being large, rubbery or hard, fixed and immovable. 

Could I have caught some process early before the hardening and pain?

Are there benign reasons to feel a left supraclavicular node?

In researching the 'net, I've seen nothing about being able to palpate normal, non-pathological left supraclavicular lymph nodes. Everything seems to suggest that you shouldn't be able to feel them. I don't seem to have any obvious symptoms other than a recent change in bowel habits right around the time I started to worry.

Is it possible that I'm feeling a non-pathological supraclavicular node?

And I am just wondering what the infection that my body can possibly be fighting. I don't feel sick at all. I haven't been sick in years actually. Can it be due to a deviated septum and polyps and blockage in the nose? because I was recently diagnosed with that.

                I've had some strange symptoms which started a month ago.  Initially I had aches in my chest which felt muscular.  About 2 weeks ago I developed dyspnea; nothing major but it felt as though I couldn't get a full breath of air when I wanted.  I'd be able to get a full breath every now and then.  Then just recently, I've developed a feeling that there is something compressing my trachea, right about the level of my suprasternal notch.  This sensation comes and goes.  Still have random chest/rib pains; particularly when I press which made me think of costochondritis...but the other symptoms don't add up. 

I'm a medical student and listened to my lungs with my stethoscope; totally clear without any wheezes, stridor, etc. 

No other symptoms aside from those described.  Doctors appointment in a few days, but right now I'm literally worrying myself sick over this.  I do have anxiety disorder and this is just about putting me over the edge.  Any advice, opinions, etc. would be very welcomed.

                Should I be concerned about lymphoma even if my blood tests came back okay?
I've had a swollen lymphnode on the left side of my neck for probably 8-9 months now. I also have a few behind my ears, one that's always there and doesn't really change along with also sometimes getting other swollen ones behind my ears that can be painful. I've never noticed any others on my body, but I also don't really look for them. 
I'm a 20 year old female, not exactly in the best health. I'm pretty much always exhausted and not feeling well. A lot of it I and others in my life just dismiss as depression/anxiety and my terrible ""IBS"" (that's a whole other story) 
A few months ago I went to my PC and told her about my lymphnodes, along with occasional night sweats (Not so much anymore, but I do get very hot when I'm asleep and am pretty much always freezing during the day) She felt and looked at them, and ordered to have a blood test done. My blood tests came back normal with no other possibility/reason for my swollen lymphnodes. The swelling hasn't gone down, when I tilt my head back it becomes pretty visible and sometimes feels almost moveable. Do my blood tests confirm that there's definitely not something wrong? Should I further pursue this or is it something I shouldn't be worried about?

                Hello,

This all began in October when I thought I had bronchitis so I did a round of antibiotics then. Then at the beginning of December I started to cough up black stuff. I was given another round of antibiotics and that did nothing for it. I saw an ent who thought it might be fungus dripping from my sinuses, so I did a cat scan and they was clear. I also had a normal scope of my nose, so ent was ruled out. I was then sent to a pulmonologist because they thought the black stuff was old blood coming from my lungs. Sometimes when I cough the black stuff is accompanied by fresh red blood . (25 year old female-not a smoker) I have had several doctors tell me how concerning the color of the black stuff is and the frequency and duration but No one knows where it's coming from. My chest X-ray was clear, but my CBC was abnormal. My WBC and absolute neutrophil count was high and two if my red blood cell counts were low. I was also tested for the alpha1 Antitrypsin but instead of the value being low, mine tested as being high. I am meeting with my doctor again tomorrow but I'm worried he's just going t refer me elsewhere, maybe to a hematologist. Since my appointment with him a few weeks ago, I have lost 5 pounds, I have drenching night sweats where I wake up and my hair is literally in strings (it's cold in my room), my voice keeps changing where it goes hoarse someone's and coughing or clearing my throat won't fix it, I'm really tired, and I'm getting really bad headaches.

                I have a small lump on my neck, it is on the right side about halfway up. It is quite small, probably not much bigger than a pea and it feels like it is located on the neck muscle (of course I suppose it could be behind it and pushing the muscle, I am not qualified to say but I don’t think so).  I have played sport before and it feels to me exactly like the kind of scar tissue you can get after a pulled muscle.  

I have over recent years ‘ricked’ my neck more than once which could point to it being scar tissue however I honestly cannot remember what side I did this on.  I have also lost some weight recently (2-3 stone which planned so it was not unexpected) so it is possible this has been there for years but has been covered in ‘padding’ and not as easy to feel.    I went to the doctors with it about 6 weeks ago and they were not concerned however whilst I am maybe being unfair the doctor was a newly qualified one and did not fill me with total confidence, nethertheless I took the advice and other than make a note to keep an eye on it have not given it another thought until the last day or 2.  I felt it again, I do not think it has changed in size but it is definitely there and after a few minutes of prodding it I noticed later that the my right ear and right gland area around my throat felt a little sore, nothing major but probably no coincidence and I wondered if it had been irritated by me poking around?

So it is worrying me again, I have recently moved house and have just registered with a new GP but it will be a week to 10 days before I can see a doctor.

Advice appreciated.

                I am a 28 year old female with a large 6 cm rubbery lump on my neck. My dr said she doesn't think it's my thyroid. I have been feeling tired and dizzy alot lately and having trouble concentrating and have tunnel vision from time to time. My dr ordered an mri, but never mentioned cancer, but I have a family history of it. No pain in the lump but I can feel it there sometimes. It seems to change in size but not sure.

                Recently, about two months ago, I noticed a small, firm lump, about the size of a pea. The boarders are unidentifiable and it Has a slightly darker and more purple skin tone as the surrounding skin. It doesn't move, and it's not painful. It's about 3 centimeters away from my hip bone. I am fairly young, a teenager, and I have had my fair share of being rejected by my parents when asked if there is something wrong. Should I worry about this lump?

                Hi there, to cut a long story short, since January last year (1 year ago) I have had enlarged lymph nodes under my left armpit. Ever since I have noticed them they have remained the same size and not grown. I have been to see my GP and he has said they are not worrisome to him at all. I have had all my bloods taken and they were completely health also. I find myself getting itchy a lot though which worries me. When I first noticed these nodes it was because I was getting a lot of pain under my armpit. I also believe I have chronic inflammation on that side of my body which could have a part to play. I'm worried I have lymphoma though. I'm a 20 year old boy. My GP said lymphoma nodes would be of considerable size if they were nodes that were going to worry him but these weren't big enough for that. Would these nodes have grown in a years time if they were likely due to lymphoma?

                My niece, who is at age 24, has been experiencing sore throat and itching on the whole body trunk at night during sleep starting from middle October 2016. A blood test done on Dec 7th 2016 found elevated leukocyte (20.39, normal range 3.5-9.5) and platelet counts and other abnormalities.  Contrast-enhanced CT scan shows irregular shape soft tissue mass in the thymus region, about 4.6x7.1 cm in size with obscure boundary. A CT-guided fine-needle aspiration biopsy and immunohistochemical test done on Dec 22nd could not confirm the mass in the mediastinum to be cancerous. While a repeated biopsy done on Jan 10th 2017 suspected the mass to be a tumor. No confirmed result is reached. She had no other symptoms or weight loss or decreased appetite. No fever or pain was observed, except the itching in the body trunk. Could anyone help to tell is it likely a thymoma or lymphoma? Is it look like benign? Any input is appreciated!

                Recent blood test show elevated eosinophils.
14.4%, norm is below 4%. Doc looked back at last years blood test. Eosinophils last year were at 8%. Doc sent me to a hematologist oncologist. He repeated blood work. Eosinophils still elevated. He then sent me out for and echocardiogram and a CT with contrast. I don't know what the results are. I'm use to doc calling with results over the phone or sending a letter that says all is AOk. Instead, his office called and scheduled a follow up for the 19th. 

I'm a little freaked out. My grandfather died from leukemia in 1970. Doc mentioned that. I looked online and his comments to test results just say Good. No CML. But he mentioned eosinophilic leukemia. 

What is that? If results are good, why the follow up appointment?

I have been extremely tired, do have bone and joint pain, and have been having terrible night sweats. I drench the sheets.

My thought it was perimenapause. I'm 44. 

Any have any info they could share with this or thoughts?

Thanks!

                For atleast a year ive had a swollen node just below my jaw which aches and can get quite uncomfortable. I have been to the doctor who said to go back in 3 weeks. I did that on the 23rd dec, and he felt it again, looked at my salivary glands too said they were fine however that my swollen gland felt firm. It moves, but he said it feels like a jelly bean rather than a jelly baby! He mentioned cancer to me since i am not ill with an infection amd has referred me on to the ent specialists. 

Im terrified. Could this mean cancer? I havent felt right in nearly 2 years with weird bowel changes and pains throughout my body.

                Hello i asked a question about a hard lymph node i had almost two months ago and i would like to ask some additional questions.

I went to my doctor who perscribed me a 10 day course of augmentin and ibuporfen almost a month ago and the hard-calcified node i had shrunk a lot. Now its very thin and its size is 1.5 cm to 2 cm also the hard node that was above it became completely soft. But about three weeks ago i had a pain in the mastoid with no ear infection i guess and after that i noticed a small hard node below and near him a big soft node. I would like to mention that this isthe side i still have an upper wisdom tooth but its not re or something it just descends. 

So my questions are can a lymphoma node shrink after antibiotics and stay that way (pretty big from 1.5 to 2 cm)
And secondly can that 3 day pain in the mastoid caused those nodes that are still here 3 weeks after without ear pain or tooth pain-redness? Thanks in advance

                I've had very large lymph nodes that I thought nothing about until I discovered a large node in my groin. It measures 4 cm. The ones in my neck are 1.1 cm near my thyroid, and the ones in my armpits haven't been measured yet, but they feel big, not hard but kind of squishy. I've been run down for over a year. I have night sweats and low-grade fevers frequently. I see a surgeon tomorrow to consult with about a biopsy in my groin. I'm a 56 year old female that is feeling more and more exhausted everyday.

                Some background about myself, I'm a 34 yr old female, healthy, work out 4-5 days a week and have no symptoms of lymphoma. I have had an enlarged lymph node (1.5cm), relatively small, size of a pea for around 6-7 months. I've also had this prolonged head cold - really minor, but I'm always slightly congested in the nose and have mucus on my throat that causes me to cough. I'm a papillary thyroid cancer suvivor (15 yrs next year), and generally get paranoid about any types of lumps that I find.

I went to the doctor 2 days ago, the visit was brief and he emphasized all my fears and here I am feeling completely confused and hopeless as I am reliving my first cancer diagnosis. He didn't question my head cold at all, which I thought was strange, said that my lump was not a lymph node and either a sebaceous cyst or a tumor on the parotid gland or a lymph node within the parotid gland. I had a biopsy - he took 4 samples and called me yesterday with the results and said it is an aggravated lymph node. He found no cancer cells and he said with lymphoma they look for duplicative white blood cells which he did not find, he found a mix which is normal.

He does say this does not rule out low grade lymphoma (I get it, my first thyroid cancer diagnosis they found nothing with a biopsy and then found cancer after removal). But he wants to give me antibiotics and steroids (I heard steroids are not good because they cause anything to shrink and cover the problem?) to see if it will shrink. He also said to come back in 4 weeks, if it hasn't he will remove it and do a pathology.

Part of me is freaking out and going through the worst case scenario. The other part of me is saying, but what about your cold? It's not a huge growth, why is he telling me it could be lymphoma? I've decided I am going to get a second opinion because the overall visit rubbed me the wrong way. However, I am more worried because in a month I am supposed to go through IVF, I am about to get engaged, I have all of these future plans happening and the c-word is making me fall into this deep paranoid depression right before the holidays. My plans to have a child have been top of mind lately, and this is making me worried that it will never happen or become a road block if I do in fact have cancer. 

If anyone has some words of wisdom, experience to share, advice - I would greatly appreciate it.

Thank you for listening,
Julia

And when a person, over 50 years old, has mono, would they always have all the obvious symptoms of a sore throat and a fever, or can one have mono without a sore throat and fever?

I have also had red and splotchy hands, which I have now learned are Livedo Retuclaris. I saw an infectious disease specialist last week and he said I tested positive for CMV and EBV but they weren't recent infections and shouldn't be the cause of my swollen lymph nodes. He also tested me for HTLV and HIV which came back negative. He also told me all my blood test came back normal, even though I had elevated monocyctes a few weeks back they now went back to normal levels. I am scheduling a biopsy to get to the bottom of these symptoms once and for all. I am very concerned that I may have contracted some new sort of STD.

                Hi there I am a 20 year old male and I have plenty of symptoms to go through that I worry may all be connected. It started 2 and a half years ago when I started getting pains on the left side of my chest, these pains can be anything from sharp pains, dull aches or a burning sensation. These pains seem to take place anywhere from above my heart and in a line diagonally across to below my armpit. For  2 and a half years these pains have been ever present. They are pains I have been able to live with and am still living with them. Recently in the past year I can say I've been through a lot. I've discovered that I have celiac disease and I have also had a pneumothorax on my right hand sided lung. When this pneumothorax occurred in February I wasn't aware of what it was and thought I was dying so I went to A and Eand they took X-rays and that's when they discovered the pneumothorax which was a relief I suppose as there was no shadows or anything of the like as I was sure I had cancer. I have had an X-ray since in July which was all clear too and I have also had all my blood work done which for the most part was all healthy. Now on to my symptoms which make me believe that I have lymphoma. Basically in January of this year I was in my bedroom playing my Xbox and for the past day my left armpit was aching quite substantially, now I had just changed deodorant and thought this may be why, so I began to feel around my left armpit and noticed a small lymph node and started freaking out a bit. From this point on I kept an eye on it and within a month or two it hadn't grown nor disappeared. Now, this was the only area I kept an eye on so I decided to feel more deeply in to my armpit a few months on and noticed there was also a couple more very very small lymph nodes and then a small marbled size one(probably the biggest). It is now nearly December and these lymph nodes to my awareness have stayed the same size. My other two most recent symptoms are night sweats which I'm not sure if it's because of my duvet cover on my bed which is a new cover as from the first day I got it I noticed I was sweating under it as it is quite heavy and heat can't really escape it. My other symptom is constant itching( mainly when I'm relaxed and in the house doing nothing), this concerns me also as I read it's a lymphoma symptom. I seen my doctor last week for the first time about all my lymphoma symptoms and at the time I only brung up the lymph nodes and my persistent 2 and a half year left sided chest problems as I thought the two may be connected and he felt under my left armpit and said he certainly wasn't concerned about the nodes as they weren't big in his mind at all and that I'm incredibly skinny it's easier to feel them and he told me lymphoma nodes would be considerably larger. He then told me that he however wanted to offer me to get all my bloods taken that he would take in suspicion of lymphoma and also because back when I got tested for celiac it came up that I had some sort of low vitamin B count or something and he said that may mean I was vitamin b deficient. So anyway I have had the bloods taken and I was phoned asking to come in and see him regarding the blood tests but luckily I have already booked in to see him and will see him tomorrow. He thinks I'm a massive hypochondriac which I suppose to some extent I am but these symptoms all seem to mimic lymphoma so I am going to ask him regardless to refer me to see someone who maybe would have more insight and I can enquire about more testing. Any thoughts on this would be great I know there are people out there with great insights, could this really be lymphoma? I'm so sure of it and I'm scared as heck

                   It started 3 days ago I woke up and had a pain in my throat when I swallowed, I figured it was nothing because I was sleeping with my mouth open because I was recovering from a slight cold, so I thought it was either dry or just drainage, though it was a little suspicious because it was only on one side. I wouldn't be worried but its happened for three days, it hurts the most when I would laugh, I'm asking because I've had a lot of strep throat and the doctors  have considered taking my  tonsil's out but never did.

                Hi there I'm a 20 year old male. In January this year I noticed a lymph node in my armpit that was small and moveable and then discovered more a couple months later in my left armpit also small and moveable. It all started when I was having pains in my left armpit and that was when I felt the nodes. Basically I am convinced this is lymphoma as since just before I turned 18 I get daily pains around my heart area, however I do also get pains all over my left side of my chest area. I recently read online about a man who said he never knew he had lymphoma until he was getting heart pains which turned out to be nodes pressing against his heart which just sent me over the edge and I'm panicking big time. I'm seeing my doctor tomorrow but I honestly feel that this must be lymphoma. I'm not constantly tired nor do I get night sweats or anything but these nodes are far to suspicious I feel so screwed I'm absolutely terrified of cancer

                Hi everyone.

Yesterday I found a lump near my clavicle bone that I had never noticed or felt before. It seems to be movable, almost as if I am able to push it back and forth. Back in February 2016, I had CT scans done and in the comment section the doctor wrote that in the level 5B area, I have a lymph node measuring 14x13mm. It previously measured at 14x10mm and it was compared to previous scans done in November 2014 and April 2014. After looking online last night I discovered that the level 5B area is right where I am feeling this lump. I should also mention that I have been sick with allergies and a bacterial infection for the past month, which involved a lot of coughing and sneezing. It is finally all cleared up with an occasional cough here and there. I had a CBC test done a few weeks ago and everything came back normal other than the bacterial infection they found. Otherwise all other numbers were normal. My question is, what could this lump be that I'm feeling? How big is 14x13mm. Is that worrisome? Is it good that it seems to have grown so little in over a year? I'm trying not to worry to much about this, but some guidance would help. Thanks in advance.

My right leg is also about an inch longer from an accident I was in , in 1981.  My ortho Dr wanted me to see a vascular Dr., I did, he did ultra sound and said my lymph glands in my right groin area were swollen and wanted me to have a biopsy right away. Also I'm HIV positive so I get labs done about every 3 months and I talked to my HIV Dr first and she thought it strange because she had never seen a problem in labs. I've had so much done, this last April I tore my rotor- cuff and just got over surgery for that, so I'm waiting til after the holidays to get a biopsy. Wouldn't my labs show there was a problem?

He did a full blood count with diff, liver test, tested to see if I was low on vitamins, he came back and said everything was perfect. (His words) well that night I went home and my whole body started to ache, and I got a low fever that only lasted a few hours until I took meds and then it never came back. Well since then I just haven't felt well, I feel really sick when I eat, my cheeks get flushed, I get random pains through out my body and I have been going to the bathroom like crazy. I have a severe severe hypochondriac, I have severe anxiety and panic attacks. Could this all be from stress of worrying I may have cancer still? Or maybe I picked up a bug? I just need some sort of answer. I see my OBGYN Monday for the bleeding. I just feel like maybe it's not leukemia, it may be lymphoma, or any other cancer. I feel like I'm going crazy.

                I can't tell on these Lab reports which this WBC is from.  I had these tests taken on 8/30 and picked them up last night because I hadn't heard from my doctor.  When I got them and tried to call all day long today, I still didn't hear back and it is kind of driving me nuts.  I have had kidney infections before - sometimes feels like it never goes away and tests always reveal another infection but this time they went further with the tests and ordered microscopic examination.  On the first part under CBC With Differential/Platelet the WBC reads 6.7  and is within normal ranges.  The second part is Urinalysis, Complete... I think everything appears normal... the next section says.  Microscopic Examination follows if indicated then goes on to list WBC at 11-30 Abnormal and then Mucus Threads Present  Abnormal.  Does anyone know if this is microscopic of the blood or of the urine.  I looked up mucus threads and found lots of information on them being from the kidney and beyond areas.  If this is from the blood, this high of a White Blood Cell count is indicative of Leukemia and a few other things, but all my symptoms match Leukemia, but some of the symptoms also indicate a kidney infection.   

I was initially sent to test for Lupus, but Antinuclear Antibodies Direct and TSH look within normal limits.  

I have symptoms of enlarged liver, fatigue, sore muscles and bones... especially in the feet and ankles, my back and upper arms are sore to the touch like deep bruises but there are no visible bruses, cuts on my legs do not heal so well anymore.  A tiny scrape takes about a month and a half to go completely away, a gland on my left side below the ear inflames and gives me an ear ache, my memory is going fast.  Anyone know anything about these blood tests and these symptoms, your comments would be most welcome.  Thanks.

Now after antibiotic still my crp is 113 and wbc is 15.6. Is that mean still im having the infection ? Is there any test to confirm that? Because as i know crp and wbc could be elevate because of lymphoma. So is there any definitive way to confirm that. Can a blood cultuer test confirm that?

                I have had a swollen lymph node in my neck for about 2 weeks now. It feels quite hard to the touch and isn't really painful. This is also accompanied by facial tingling particularly along the jaw line. For the past 4 months I have also been suffering severe headaches that induce nausea as well as a light headed feeling. I have nasal congestion and often a feeling of fullness in my ears. Sometimes I notice my chest feels tight when I inhale deeply. My GP has suggested it may be a sinus infection. Just before the swollen lymph node appeared I had two episodes of drenching night sweats. In addition I have woken up many times with a numb right arm. I have just finished a 5 day course of amoxicillin but this has not eased any of the symptoms. On examination, my GP found I had a raised temperature and heart rate but couldn't find any other sign of infection. I am very worried that I have something serious such as lymphoma. Any advice would be much appreciated.

Thanks,

Ashleigh

                2 weeks ago- normal cold (2 days, recovered) 
1 week ago- comes back as sinus infection/bronchitis 

a few days into the new infection I went to the doctor, as it was getting worse. I was prescribed Amoxicillin. 3/4 days later (about halfway into course) I stopped taking the pills since I felt better. Two days ago I started to blow my nose a lot but I thought it was allergies. Then the mucus mostly went away (although I can ""taste"" it when I cough even though nothing's coming up) and that night I felt weak, dizzy, slightly confused, and when I got into bed I immediately got so cold that I had to wear sweats and all the blankets I had (didn't check temp but definitely a fever). I eventually fell asleep but was so cold. Today the symptoms are worse, but again, the symptoms changed from nonstop mucus/coughing/sneezing to fatigue, fever, chills, severe coldness randomly throughout day and always at night. My mouth/throat also feel really hot which is weird; I'm very hydrated. Also, slight joint pain in back, knees, shoulders. 

So then I typed in my symptoms in along with fact that my immune system has been crap, and multiple sites said I could have Leukemia. I'm 18. College freshman, dorming. I'm very scared. It doesn't run in the family. Am I being ridiculous? Last night I started with remaining pills and tomorrow I'm going to UHS walk in.

                Hello, 

Basically I have had large lymph nodes in my next for several years now. They are hard and feel like they are attached to something and are painless! I have one on the left side of my neck (which is between my head and shoulder) and I have one under my chin and one on the back left side of my neck. I am really freaking out. In the past I have had a Ultrasound and the doctors did not seem to worry about it saying it doesn't look like anything to worry about and that lymph nodes can just stay enlarged after an infection has been caught.

Can someone shed any light on my situation please?

Thank you

                Hi

After sole advice my husband is being tested for lymphoma he has a lump on his neck that hasnt gone away in 4 months suffers with night sweats night fever generally feeling tired all time and recently his neck is starting to ache saw consultant yesterday who is organising urgent biopsy ct and mri scan they gave him a once over the nurse made a point of telling consultant his left tonsil is also swollen and inflamed. He has no sore throat etc that you would get with tonsillitis so was shocked when she said this. 

Its only when came home and googled it that it can either me a sign of lymphoma or a form or lymphoma has anyone known lf this also i can read blood results because of the job i do as consultant was talking his bloods were up on screen. His calcium is high which ive read can be another sign of cancer and his mch was high another sign also. The consultant wouldnt tell us either way what his thought was just we needed biopsy and images.

His cousin had lymphoma 2 years ago but it came bk and unfortunately he passed away this year can it run in families
Im really worried hubby isnt he reckons it will be a cyst!

                So I've been experiencing quite a few problems for awhile now, and doctors mostly seem to dismiss it without much thought. I'm constantly sick with viruses and infections, I have constant fatigue and just an overall continual feeling of being off, as well as feeling clammy and feverish at night. About a month ago, I noticed a lymph node in my neck was enlarged (not big enough to be seen, but can be felt under the skin.) My appetite has gone down, but not enough to justify the weight I've started to lose. I also have started feeling short of breath a majority of the time, with a tightness in my chest that makes it feel like I can't take a full breath. Naturally, I started searching for answers because I desperately hope that there's a reason why I feel this way, and that I'm not destined to go on without a cause. Now, as unlikely as it is, my symptoms do coincide with those of Hodgkin's (and some of non Hodgkin's) Lymphoma. I got blood tests a few weeks ago for a different reason, and now my main question here: Does a normal white blood count rule out Lymphoma? I know it can't be used to diagnose the cancer, but would it definitely be abnormal if I had something wrong with my Lymphatic system, such as Lymphoma? Thanks!

                I'm 21 years old. I've been sick for about 6 weeks now. My symptoms are extreme fatigue, weight loss (about 12 pounds), difficulty breathing, and bruising very easily. I just checked out of the hospital yesterday, where I was admitted for pneumonia and a high WBC count. When I checked out, I was told my WBC is still too high, and that I'll need to get it checked soon. I'm becoming concerned because even though I left the hospital, I am still incredibly weak and don't have the energy to do anything or go anywhere. I will have to return to work on Monday, and at this point, I don't know if I will have the physical energy. I began to look into causes of high WBC count, and I saw the symptoms of leukemia. I have every single one, including the night sweats. However, I also read that prednisone can cause a high WBC count as well. My question is, is prednisone a strong enough medicine that it could be causing all my symptoms? I've had a prednisone injection, as well as several rounds of the pills, since the time I began feeling ill. Is prednisone that strong?

                Hello 

My Partner is 21 years old female and over the last few years has been suffering with a few throat infections a year and also quite frequent ulcers.

She had bloods taken and they came back fine a few times but still persisted to have them done. She then had more tests done and shown low WBC/ low Neutrophils around 1.4. She has had ones since and they have come back around 2.5. She has been to see the immunologist and she referred her to the haematologist. He examined her blood and said the 2.5 is low but not too low and are okay. She said he said your levels are fine but some look abnormal so we need to look why. He said that some of the Neutrophil cells are not containing all that they should.

She asked is there a risk of leukaemia he said she is 'not at high risk' but with symptoms coming on not from birth he needs to check everything. He also said he is not primarily looking leukaemia what could he mean by that?

She has no other leukaemia symptoms apart from these frequent ulcers and throat infections.

I just have a few questions

Does this sound like Leukemia?

Would the WBC/Neutrophil count be normally higher if it was Leukaemia?

Could Leukemia Cause the abnormal Neutrophils?

I am so very scared right now and any information you can give would help so much she has her test next week and hopefully results asap! I am so worried I have looked on the internet for information and it only ever puts me onto leukaemia or myelodysplastic syndrome and this is what worries me.

                Hi, my name is Lucas and I'm from Brazil, than sorry about my poor english, but I think it will be enough for you to understand. I am 24, healthy male, with no past serious disorders.

Let me begin saying I am an hypochondriac and really have fear about having malignant disorders, specially Lymphoma. My concerns really increased when my grandma (age 82) was diagnosed with Cell B Lymphoblastic Lymphoma, in a really agressive form, that took her life in one month (specially because she wasn't able to receive chemo due to her health condition & being intubated).

The thing is, I always had the habit to check for lymph nodes, specially in my cervical area. One month ago, I began to check the supraclavicular area and found two enlarged lymph nodes on the left side. Than, I scheduled a appointment with the same Doctor that was taking care of my grandma, a Hematologist with experience in treating lymphomas. He felt the lymph nodes, said they were tender and movable, but refered to a Ultrasound check on the  cervical and supraclavicular areas. The test came back with preserved and normal anatomy of the lymph nodes, with one measuring 0.7 cm and the other 1.1 cm in diameter. He also refered to blood tests, which came back normal, including some virus serologies and Lactate Dehydrogenase. 
The doctor said to come back in 5 weeks to check again the lymph nodes, but he told me that there's nothing to care about, as he says he palps lymph nodes everyday and mine are normal.
Although that, being an hypocondriac, and having family history, I'm worried cause I read some really concerning things about Supraclavicular Lymph Node enlargement. 
I have no other symtoms, except for a feeling of Bugs crawling on my skin (Formication), like a burning sensation, specially on my legs, which my doctor said it could be due to anxiety, associetad with hypocondriac disorder. I really believe it's due to anxiety.

My question is: although my doctor said not to worry about my lymph nodes, should I be really concerned about them? I really need another opinion. Thanks!

                Hi everyone,

I have a follow up 6 month appointment coming up and I have to admit, anxiety is creeping in. I posted my concern back in February when I got my follow up report back. I would like to repost the findings again just for reassurance and to see if there is anything that I should mention to my doctor.

My report says: ""There are lymph nodes of the right level Ia, Ib, 2A, IIb, 3, 4, 5 day and 5B and sub occipital regions. These lymph nodes are more numerous than is typically identified. The largest lymph node involves the right level 5B station measuring up to 14 x 13 mm in size. This is slightly larger having previously measured 14x10 mm.""

It goes on to say: ""The left neck also demonstrates level Ia, Ib, periparotid, 2A, IIb, 3, 4, 5A, 5B and sub occipital lymph nodes. The largest left neck node involves the left Ia station measuring 13 x 8 mm. Previously it measured 11 x 10 mm.""

This was done in February 2016 and it was compared to comparisons from November 2014 and April 2014. And the doctor who performed the CT scan wrote that ""Overall, these lymph nodes are stable to perhaps marginally more prominent from prior study.""

At the time my ENT said there was really nothing to be worried about at the moment and he wanted to see me back in 6 months. And the appointment is approaching in a little over a week. My concern are the sizes. Are these sizes worrisome? I also would like to know what is the ""danger size."" And considering the time frame of over a year in comparison of the reports, are the size differences good or bad, a lot or a little? Its past 4am, so clearly this is weighing on my mind. Thank you for your time.

                At the beginning of the year I had gotten a Swollen Lymph Node in my left underarm that lasted about three (3) months which was painless, I thought nothing of it. I started to loose a lot of weight; about 20 pounds. I was really tired all the time and sleeping wasn't helping me, and I would bruise easily. I told my parents but they also thought nothing of it. 

Around the Month of May, everything stopped. I've gained some of my weight back because I was eating a lot. I was still really tired all the time and the swollen lymph node was gone. 
On the 12th of August 2016 I discovered two swollen lymph nodes in my groin area. 
One hurts really bad and the other doesn't, only when I apply pressure. Since that day I've been having headaches and occasional diarrhoea. 
I also encountered a slight rash on my calves a few days after. 
I've started to lose weight again and I can't walk too long distances or go up the stairs without being winded.
On Monday, I saw there was a swollen lymph node on my left underarm and it was very tiny and it didn't hurt at all. 
But now, it's getting bigger and its very painful when I raise my arm and even when my arm is down. 
Also the lymph nodes in my groin are still there but they went down a little. 

I have a doctor's appointment in the morning and I'm really nervous. 
Please tell me your opinions.

                Okay, so I had some ultrasounds and a CT done on my neck about a year ago. The ultrasound showed some abnormal lymph nodes, with the biggest being about 9mm. The CT showed absolutely nothing so my doctor just dropped the case as palpable benign lymph nodes (I made a post about this a little over a year ago). Well now I can feel more lymph nodes (one on the side of my neck, a few more in the submandibular/sub mental region, and one on the opposite lower side of my neck), all about a centimeter size. The original nodes are still there and don't seem to have grown. I have to get another ultrasound done and most likely a FNA. My new doctor did blood work and doesn't seem too concerned and doesn't think it's cancerous based on that, she is just doing the FNA just in case. From what I've read, Lymphoma usually doesn't make an appearance in blood work, even if I've had it for almost two years. 

To summarize:
- I'm a 20 year old female, I first found the the nodes when I was 18.
- it has taken about a year for 3 or 4 more nodes to pop up.
- Indolent lymphomas are extremely rare for someone my age so I don't THINK it could be that.
- Is it normal for Hodgkin's to grow this slowly?
- I have impacted wisdom teeth and swollen gums from when I had braces, so maybe that could be causing this?

Unfortunately, I'm a huge hypochondriac, so these tiny little lumps in my neck are causing me all sorts of problems.

                Recently completed a round of testing to perhaps explain why I have been in significant abdominal pain for a long time.  The latest bout is 6+ months.  I can't make out from these results what may be going on and I do intend to see a urologist but that visit is a few weeks away, so in the meantime I am wondering if this seems familiar to anyone.
Problem areas of results:
Blood, UA:  Large
RBC, UA:  10-50 hpf (so red blood cells in urine)
Bacteria:  Rare
Squam Epithel, UA:  Moderate
Enlarged Lymph Nodes
CT scan noted no significant issues beyond the somewhat enlarged lymph nodes.
Physician's note said he suspected a viral abdominal infection. (Could that be possible at the six month mark?)

Should I be concerned?

                Hi there,
About six weeks ago I've got very sore throat followed by cough, swollen lymph nodes and white patches on the back of the throat. I went to doctor and he prescribed me penicillin but It didn't really seem to help. After a while when I realize symptoms won't go away on it's own I went to doctors again and he prescribed me another round of different antibiotics which I finished today. However, I noticed that throat isn't as sore as before although white dots on the back are still present as well as one huge lymph node on the left side of my neck. Now, throat doesn't bothers me so much anymore since It got a bit better but that enlarged lymph node doesn't seem to go away or decrease for 8 weeks now. Its hard on touch but I can kind of move it under skin and it's not visible but I can definitely touch it. It is also not very painful but from  time to time it is a bit tender on touch. I wouldn't be so concerned since I know lymph modes tend to swell during infections and I definitely had one but It worries me that this is happening just on one side and doesn't disappear even now when infection is almost completely cured. I would like to hear your opinion does this sounds like lymph node cancer, should I be concerned about that? My doctor doesn't seem to pay too much attention on node itself as he rather focuses on the infection but I think this doesn't has to do anything with throat anymore. Please give me advice I am very worried, thank you so much for your time!

I am a 53 year old female.  I am worried about having a lymphoma, leukemia or tonsil cancer.  
My symptoms started suddenly last Saturday.  I noticed a left ear ache when swallowing.  It became quite severe. I had been boating a lot in the wind so thought it was from that. No fever.  Woke up Monday morning and felt worse.  Looked in throat-red and left side looked swollen.  Went to PCP and he said tonsillitis, pharyngitis. Temp was 99.4 but haven't had any temp since.  Taking Tylenol/Advil around the clock for discomfort.  Put on Azithromycin and Zovirax (in case there were any cankers behind tonsil that he couldn't see).  Also had routine blood drawn for upcoming physical.   Got results yesterday.  Wbc 14.3 and Abs Neuts 12.18. The remaining CBC was completely normal.  Throat/ear is still very sore at times and still red.   Finished antibiotic yesterday   Possibly slightly improved.  Does this sound like just a throat infection or something more serious?  Please advice.

                I have a follow up with my doctor next week, but I'm trying to understand these in the meantime.  She is testing me for CLL and Hodgkin's lymphoma due to some abnormal CBC and a few other symptoms.  I do not quite understand all the medical terminology, so  I was wondering if someone could break this down for me:

Suspect incidental lymph nodes overlying the left trapezius muscle in the axial plane of the lower neck; paramidline to the left by approx 6 cm; correlation only

Prominence at the level overlying the right sternocleidomastoid in the axial plane of C5 is speculated as to likely be related to the mild to moderate mid-to-lower cervical dextroscoliosis; coincident focal duplex pattern of the right external jugular at this level noted; not a lesion

Tiny cyst midleft love of thyroid suspect; possibly a nodule

Hi, I have a question about my blood work. I'm  hoping someone here can help me as I don't see my doctor for a few days. I actually have a WBC count on the lower side but a huge percentage, double the upper limit of normal, of these WBC's are lymphocytes. Do you know if that could be leukemia or does leukemia always present with high WBC count in conjunction with differential abnormalities like mine? I have most of the symptoms of leukemia with the exception of fever. I know there are many other tests needed to get a diagnosis and I am of course hoping it isn't cancer, but I haven't been able to find any info on what could cause high lymphocyte percentages in normal or low-normal wbc counts. Thank you

                Hello,
Well my story is little bit long and full of question marks. But I'll try to make it clear as I can.

I have swollen lymph nodes all over my body. It all started after I hung out with a guy. We never had sex because none of us had a condom at that moment. But we performed oral on each other and he also fingered me. This happened a few time. After 1 weeks after the first time we made out I woke up with an intense pain in my right ovary. The pain did go away in 3 or 4 days and after that I totally forgot about it. Then like one week before my next period I had pain right side of my uterus and my period was late 4 days and there was quite heavy flow. Pain never went away but diminished with every period. My hormone levels changed. For almost 3 months I couldn't lie on my left side because I feel like there is a mass in my right groin area and it tries to move down and it kinda hurt. And after the second period after event I had something like vaginal thrush with excess amount of discharge but the thing is there was no smell or color. While the situation is awkward with my uterus a burnish tinglish feeling occurred in right side of my groin. Next month with period I had it on both side. This feeling is like burning, tingling and it occurs in inner thighs, groin and right side of lower abdominal. Till that day I never thought of an STD because I had all the pain on my right side, I had no discharge showing something was wrong. I thought it was something about my ovary. I still get tested though and blood work and urine work came out normal. I had no STD.

But almost 3 months after first we made out I had a sore throat for no reason and it didn't get any better for like 3 weeks. I had excessive night sweats. I was always exhausted and cold. My armpits hurt. I had headache almost all the time. With these symptoms I had testes for HIV, hepatitis and syphilis. It all came out negative again. 

Anyway then I noticed bumps on both sides on my groin. I went to doctor and confirmed (ultrasound) they are lymph nodes. (about 15 x 5 mm both side) She suggested STD tests again which came out clean again and she put me on antibiotics for swollen lymph nodes. But the swelling didn't go away. She suggested me to see another doctor so I went.

This time she tested me for cancer. A full blood work was done and it was normal. She said there is nothing to worry, there is nothing wrong and lymph nodes aren't that big so there is no need for a biopsy. I had pneumonia at the end of may. With that a few more swollen nodes popped up and they also didn't go away. 

I can feel something is wrong. I lost a lot of weight in this process. I can't eat properly. I feel full after a small amount of food and I don't even get hungry. I get exhausted very easily. After a tiring day(well for others it's just a normal day) I get sick with fever and night sweats. My immune system doesn't really work. I am always cold. Even after a slip of cold water I get sore throat. Even a breeze can make me have cold. The nodes hurt sometimes but especially when I'm sick. Some of them soft and movable or fixed, some of them are hard and fixed.

Now it's clear I don't have any bacterial infection. Can it be something viral? Or worse can it be cancer even though the doctors say the opposite. Please share your thoughts cuz I know if I go to another doctor she or he will done another CBC and it will came out normal. 

I really need your advice.
Thanks a lot.

                Hi, I've been having a few of these symptoms for years now, but its just been brought to my attention that I might possibly have leukemia. I had told him I was feeling nauseous an he had said you gt sick very often it's like you have leukemia. I was confused and he explained to me why he thought that, it wasn't meant to be taken seriously but I looked up some of the symptoms and I have/had a lot of them. I'll list some of them:
1. Red spots under the skin in patches, this happened often when I was younger but not as often now (but I still get them every few weeks in small amounts)
2. Unexplained bruises, happens often
3. Constant nausea and/or dizziness. Nausea happens about 2-3 times every week. Dizziness every few days. 
4. Joint/Bone pain, this happens very often. (almost everyday)
5. Bleeding gums, this happened a lot before I got braces but probably because I didn't floss but once every few weeks.
I'm probably overreacting so I don't want to go to my mom about making me a doctors appointment. If you would please answer this on whether or not I should go to a doctor or any questions about my symptoms or anything you could do to help me that would be great!

                Info: I am a male, in my mid-twenties, no smoking, casual drinking (12 beers a week), history of depression, 5'10 200 lbs, acceptable HR and blood pressure.

Allergic to bees. EBV (mono) when I was a teenager. 

Family history: I think my Grandma's mother died of some sort of lymphoma. Dog died of lymphoma too, that was sad. 

Meds/Drugs: Adderall XR 30mg morning, 15mg afternoon
                      Vitamin D, Fish Oils daily

Backstory: 

March: Came home for Spring Break and had incredible fatigue daily and inability to sleep decently (only melatonin supplements occasionally but didn't help). While I couldn't sleep, I explored my body as one does, and found an enlarged inguinal lymph node (>1.5cm). Over a few weeks, I found one of the other side as well. Both were (and are) around with the persistent inability to sleep. Nodes are firm/rubbery, not sure what is meant by fixed, these are the first lymph nodes I've had that were swollen and I've felt. But I am pretty sure they are fixed. 

May: Swollen lymph nodes still there, fatigue still there, now there is bloating and I feel full all the time (even if my stomach says it's hungry, it physically feels filled). Go to doctors, takes blood, normal CBC w/ diff and metabolic panel is clean.

Mid-May: Find a few more, slightly tender, smaller lymph nodes in groin and I have pains in my ribs (cartilage, not bone).

Early June: New CBC w/ Diff and I am still clean and no STD's and Urinalysis is clean. Only test that showed abnormal showed I had EBV in my teens, but it isn't active.

Mid June: All fatigue, sleeplessness, enlarged nodes, pain in ribs, and bloating still here. Now I am feeling around my chest and find that in my supraclavicular node area is pain/what could be swollen nodes. Now I found, 100% certain of, epitrochlear nodes by my elbow are enlarged (>1cm), painless and firm. With these new above the diaphragm enlargements with some being painless I am going to go to the Walk-In soon I think. 

So now, should I be worried? Does this warrant further action? Hope I gave enough info! Thanks!

The persist pain is what bothers and worries her. 

She have went for blood test and all seems well. No anomalies were found even for cancer markers or white blood cells level.

My most recent blood work came back with a WBC of 15.4 (norm=3.8-10.8) and a MCV 106.9 (norm=80-100) MCH & RDW both elevated with a low MCHC, LAST an Absolute neutrophils levels of 11,935.  I am going to see the Hematologist today. Everything I read on line seems to indicate Leukemia?  For those with experience, are these the kind of levels you see. I have literally no symptoms other than I get hot quickly & will sweat profusely when this happens. Any help is MUCH appreciated. I am very nervous, 

Thanks xo

His pediatrician ordered a full blood work up and his results came bath with multiple ""low"" results in regards to WBC, B cells, T cells, and immunoglobulins. My mother and mother in law are both nurses, and after looking at the blood work, they have mentioned the possibility of leukemia. He had a bloody nose on 2 different occasions last week (he does not have any sinus issues going on right now and does not have a history of this either) has been complaining of leg pain off and on for about a year, and has been complaining every day pretty much all day if not feeling good (he says his body feels weird. The only other things he's mentioned is having a headache and feeling like the house is shaking (dizziness) about a month ago, he did have a rash in a few places that seemed to itch and if water touched it, he freaked out. My question is based on the blood work results I'm going to post below, and the symptoms listed above, anyone that has dealt with leukemia, does this sound like it could be a possibility? We have an appointment with an immunologist on Wednesday morning. Also, any help on explaining the blood work results would be helpful as well! Thank you in advance...
Glucose was high at 106
Under immunoglobulin g, the subclass 1 panel was low at 294 and the subclass panel 2 was high at 348

Under the CBC, the white blood cell count is low at 3.4, the absolute neutrophils are low at 1455, and the absolute lymphocytes are low at 1333. 
His ANA screen was negative. I didn't list anything that was in the normal range, just the abnormal range. Anyone that can help, please, any insights would be so appreciated! I want to be educated and prepared!

                Hi, i have recently found two swollen lymph nodes, one above my collarbone and one at the top of my jaw under the ear (not sure what this one is called?) both on the right. I have had night sweats for about 18 months, very run down and tired, and itchy armpits of all things. My doctor is thinking lymphoma so done blood tests and chest xray which came back fine. I am being sent to see a hematologist so just wating for the appointment. Im guessing a biopsy is going to be the only answer to if it is or isnt lymphoma, im trying not to worry, hopefully it will all be fine.

My question is, the lymph nodes are slowly getting bigger every day, not by much but they seem to be growing. Is this somewhat normal? Or could this be a sign that it is somehow getting worse?

                Hi. I am a 27 year old female. It all started with some bothersome gastrointestinal problems. Went to my GP and diagnosed me with gastric reflux for which he prescribed antacids. Symptoms of burning seemed to fade, except one: a gnawing chest pain. Since that, all has worsened. I have three swollen cervical lymph nodes, blurry vision, left shoulder pain, a rash that comes and goes and frequent headaches. I've had CBC's done, and bloodwork always seems normal. Went to an ENT which disregarded the lymph nodes as not worrisome. My throat feels swollen all the time. I've been to the hospital in numerous occasions for the chest pains and they always refuse to take a chest x ray, and send me home with painkillers. It is exhausting not being listened to! I am trying my hardest not to pay attention to the symtoms, but they are just too worrisome. 

I know unless I don't have some sort of biopsy or more thorough imaging diagnosis I'll never know. But, has anyone had similar symptoms before?

                I went to a pool party yesterday and drank vodka (usually just a beer girl), and I was incredibly drunk by the evening. I was with friends all evening and slept at the house we had been at. When I woke up this morning, the back of my head (starting just above my hairline and going up about two inches) is very, very tender. When I gently touch it, it almost feels like two circular swollen areas about two inches in diameter. I have never had this happen before and I'm really freaked out. I was with them pretty much every moment and they said I never fell or banged my head on anything. Is this an after-effect from drinking so much? I've been reading things about lymph nodes reacting kind of like this to alcohol when you have lymphoma. What do you think is going on? Should I be concerned?

I started out with viral type symptoms roughly 2 years ago, had rashes on the arms and no appetite, with fatigue. months after the initial symptoms i developed a chest cold with a bad productive cough. I was given antibiotics, to which the dr stated it was bronchitis. no relief what so ever. 

6 months from that point the cough was still around which became more of shortness of breath at times, and some days i could or could not produce any phlegm. I also started noticing skin lesions on my forearms that took months to heal. with recurring mouth ulcers. 

I then went and had multiple blood tests. CBC all normal, hiv tests negative, chest x ray normal, allergy test ok, echo cardio gram of the heart, asthma test normal, breathing test normal. 

To this point almost 2 years with these symptoms and im getting very frustrated as I am trying to get back into shape and any sort of intense workout leaves me very short of breath and constantly hacking up mucus. some days it feels like when I take a breath it just wont stick. 

Any guidance and help would be very much appreciated. I am desperate at this point as I have spent way to much money than i can afford from bouncing around from doctor to doctor.

                I am a 30 yr old F, who has Ehlers Danlos Syndrome. Although this causes many problems, my drs are positive i also have developed another disease, which is progressing rapidly.  Since last year of may 2015 here is whats been happening, all which is new onset.
-Started unintentionaly losing weight rapidly, i was a size 16 now currently may 2016 size 6 :( even though i eat everything pizza, cake ect.
-extreme weakness/fatigue worse than anything ive ever had, breathlessness, even just from talking.
-also sudden hemoraghing and periods lasting months at a time.
-getting constant infection after infection, chest, kidney,throat, sinus repeat

-slight anemia, lymphocytes slightly low, only one time low neutrophils. Negative ANA ESR CRP

January 2016- i bacame so weak,so fatigued,passing out, and new onset of absense seizures.
-all my specialists are so concerned by my drastic weight loss, and that i look so frail, pale and weak.
-started getting severe pains in back of head (mris were fine)
-fast forward to April this year, i am now so weak and breathless i cannot even do dishes, or get groceries. Have now developed some type of blockage in throat/esophagus.
-swollen tonsil on right side(no infection) for 6 weeks now
-my dr found my lymph nodes were swollen, some hard, non movable. And one that moves. 
-as i am now unable to eat due to a mysterious throat blockage, and feeling so full with pain after 2 bites, have lost another 10pnds in April
-ultrasound of thyroid showed 2 nodules ""4mm predominently hypoechoic mixed solid nodule"" and ""6mm solid iso echoic nodule"".   The ultrasound tech was rude and wouldnt scan any of my lymph nodes, stating ""its probly bones"". And then they wrote no worrisome cervical lympadenopathy.

-waiting months for endoscopy still, meanwhile i am so ill now i cannot go out, barely shower, and even talking makes me out of breath. I am slowly fading away. Any opinions or help is so very much appreciated.

Thank you everyone for listening

                In late early July 2013 i was diagnosed with Epididymitis.  I te4sted negative for major bacterial causes.  The doctor suspects a viral infection of some sort.  I was told to wait it out.  I went to walk in clinic three weeks later as i began getting a pain in my goin on the right side.  It seemed to stick out a little more than the left.  The doctor said it could be hernia or a swollen lymph node which would make more sense with a genital infection present.  He sent me for an ultrasound to confirm the lump.  It was  confirmed a swollen lymph node:  ""mildly enlarged right goin lymph node corresponding to the area of tenderness with mostly benign features likely reactive and of questionable significance.""  it measure 19.3mm x 11.1mm x 5.7mm.  My issue is that it is a month past that that diagnosis.  I can't tell if the lump is any bigger, but i do know the pain has not gone away and slightly increased.  Pain spreads to my upper right thiigh, right buttock, right lower back and kidney area.  In early july i had my annual physical and my blood work came back clean.  nothing unusual our outstanding.  My concern is lymphoma.  Can anyone please comment.  I have an appointment with my doctor tomorrow to review the pain i have in my groin and thigh.

                I am wondering what may be wrong with me. I have had infections o
In the past because I am a wrestler and recently around February I got a staph infection where I went to my doctor and got treated. During that my lymph nodes in my groin swelled and I'm not positive but maybe elsewhere. When I went in to get treated my doctor said they should go down after a while. They never did but they never gained any size and maybe lessened a little bit. I also have a swollen lymph node under my chin and I think both sides of my neck. None have increased from when I first noticed them and they aren't overly large at all. They move and have no hardness to them. I also have not had any other symptoms lately that are irregular just the lymph nodes and I am concerned.

                I had a seizure which landed me in the hospital it was due to stress lack of sleep and coming off xanax. I went to the dr, they suggested when I got out and the 3rd time I saw him he was poking around my stomach and both him and his intern said my spleen was enlarged. I don't have insurance and that is another story and he wanted to do tests. Also my white blood cell count was a little bit high. I have been very tired and after reading about enlarged spleens it says the only way a dr can tell if it is enlarged is by doing it with his hand is if the patient is very slender and I haven't been called that in decades. I am 59. I am also worried I may have cancer. I know I need to get more tests done but I don't have the money because I am in an estate fight with my sister and she says she has gold coins and stuff and she is not going to give them to me. She has addiction problems and had her license revoked for 10 years and was involved in my brothers death. She even asked me to say she was in Miami when my brother died but she was in the same place he was. Mia in Miami

http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm495253.htm

April 11, 2016

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration today approved Venclexta (venetoclax) for the treatment of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) who have a chromosomal abnormality called 17p deletion and who have been treated with at least one prior therapy. Venclexta is the first FDA-approved treatment that targets the B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL-2) protein, which supports cancer cell growth and is overexpressed in many patients with CLL.

                So I went into my doctor because I have been extremely lethargic , so tired , the littlest things make me exhausted , my whole body is aching , joints and chest , in general I feel crappy to say it nicely 

My blood work came back and I'm signed up on a patient portal which alerts me to tests that have come back 
My neutrophils were 78 
My lymphocytes were 17 

A little back ground on myself , I am a type 1 diabetic on a insulin pump , I am 35 and had to have a hysterectomy when I was 24 due to having cancer cells in my uterus - 
I moved a few months ago and have only seen this doctor twice , so she only knows me by medical records 
She wrote me a email stating she couldn't rule out leukemia ( please note this was over a email ) we have never spoken about this face to face and to repeat blood work in 2 weeks . 
I was so shocked I called right away after receiving her email - 
This is the response I got 
"" you need to stop worrying your going to give yourself a headache "" 
Oh my god of course I am worried ! Everyone in my family has passed away from cancer ! 

My question really is - should I be worried about these low & high numbers ? 
They were not like this a year ago ....

                Not sure if this is the right community, but when I googled my blood test counts, this came up.

Recent blood tests show low neutrophils segmented percent at 40.4% (50-70% normal), high eosinophils percent at 14.1% (1-5% normal), and high eosinophils absolute at .9 (.05-.5 normal) 

What does this mean? 

Doctor said due to allergies (hay fever) but I have NO symptoms of allergies. I do have a middle ear infection. I swim A LOT and didn't do the best job getting my ears dry. However, that's not bad. It doesn't hurt. I went to doc to get it checked because it was itching and sounding clogged. Other than that. Zero symptoms. 

However, I have been having other ""odd"" things going on. They include 
Trigeminal neuralgia (MRI indicated nothing. Determined idiopathic) 
Drenching night sweats 
Right ring finger joint pain, swelling, and redness 
Left tibia shin pain intermittent. Sometimes feel sharp pain with normal walking 
Flare ups of itchy skin - right hand only. Feels like pin prick coming through underside of skin 
FREQUENT diarrhea 
EXTREME fatigue 
Sometimes neck lymph nodes swell and become painful. They don't swell big. Small round and tender.

I'm 44, female, 5'3, 128 lbs, swim 30 laps daily 

Any ideas? Should this be concerning? Normal? 

Thanks for any help.

                I have been having a lot of pain down my rt leg for about the last 2 weeks.  Had a hip MRI, it was fine....I DO have some bulging discs in my back with some nerve impingement.....but I have never had pain in my groin that goes down the front of my leg, into my knee. So, had a doppler this last week.  No clots, but the lymph nodes in my groin are extremely large.  I was put on Doxycycline, for 5 days now, 2 times daily. Still no change.  Just very frustrated.  This is NOT in my head. I don't like going to the doctor as it is, I am not a great patient. I've done radiology for the last 20+ years, and am used to being on the other side of the fence. My doctor said that we probably needed to do a biopsy on my lymph nodes. Just wondering if you think this is truly necessary.  Both of my legs are swelling, with no change.  I am constantly either freezing or hot......also irritating.  Just wanted to know if biopsy is really necessary?  Also, have swollen nodes in my groin, under my arms, and in my neck.

                Ok, I've had an enlarged spleen for a few years now. Doc didn't take it too serious until about 6 months ago when it had slightly grown more at which time she sent did all kinds of groovy blood tests including sending out to Mayo clinic for a smear. When that all came back ok she sent me to a blood cancer doc who was horrible! Right off the bat she starts going on about lymphoma and Leukemia and bone marrow and spleen biopsies etc. scared the living ""bleep"" out of me and quite frankly angered me to no end! She wanted to start with a CT scan but since I had just had an abdominal ultrasound my insurance said they wouldn't cover it. Cancer doc then said that since my blood work was good that she thought it unlikely it was cancer but referred me to a rheumatologist who I see in June I believe because something in my blood work came back with something about connective tissue or something, never got a straight answer I was just thrilled to not go back and see her. Fast forward 6 months to this week when I was now having pain in my liver area as well as my spleen, found 5 unexplained bruises on my legs, was exhausted etc and instant full on panic set in so I went to the ER where I had blood work and a CT. Blood work came back at just over 15K wbc and slightly elvated platelets at 470. Doc said those weren't good but at the same time said that the CT scan I was so afraid of showed not only no swollen lymph glands or tumors, but that my spleen looked normal size! I honestly didn't believe her, how could that be? I even asked several times but she assured me everything looked ok. So now back to the worrisome blood work. Even when I had been sick my wbc has never been that high. I should add that I have crippling fatigue, related or not, who knows. Now I understand that when most people are diagnosed their counts are 40,60 plus but I've also heard that in CML that it comes in very slowly and creeps up. So my question is, if my smear 6 months ago showed no cancer or pre cancer cells, could this be the start of some type of liekemia? I asked the doctor that question flat out and all she said was ""it's not leukemia right now"". Comforting eh?

                We ended up taking my eldest son to emerg for what we thought might be inhalation issues from painting in a classroom all day with no ventilation when he started vomiting the next morning, as we just wanted to be safe. As it happened, our family doctor was working in emerg that day and told us that it was not inhalation. We discussed the fact that he had been vomiting once or twice a month for the past few months without reason and he ordered us an outpatient ultrasound for later in the week to see if there were any issues. Both myself and my youngest son have Celiac Disease and our doctor is very attentive to any stomach issues as there is a hereditary aspect to it. Anyway, later that evening he spiked a fever and ended up having influenza which spread through the house. We missed the initial ultrasound as everyone was sick, but I called and rebooked for a week later. He had the abdominal ultrasound done and the tech kept asking if he had been having any stomach pain, we said no. We had to go back to emerg for results (standard protocol because we were referred through emerg), and when the emerg doctor came in with the results he asked again if my son had been having any stomach pain. He said that the ultrasound was clear for any issues they were looking but that they incidentally found multiple prominent lymph nodes in the peripancreatic region, largest lymp node measuring 2.0 x 1.6 x 0.9 cm. Everything else looked completely normal. No other area had enlarged lymph nodes or swelling of any kind. We were told to repeat the ultrasound in 3 - 4 weeks. I said that I was concerned that it was localized and the doctor said that it could be due to him having the flu the week before, but the fact that they were only around the pancreas has me very frightened. I went and saw my family doctor just to ask questions and he said that it could be due to lymphoma, but that at this point he isn't really concerned and would be comfortable rechecking a few times over 6 months to see if the size of the nodes go down before ordering a biopsy. I know it is not smart to look things up online, but I can't find any reassuring  information. I am so frightened and feeling like I am floating outside of my body.... I just want him to be alright, but if something is wrong I want to know ASAP so that we can do something about it.... Please help.... It seems that influenza wouldn't just cause an issue with those specific lymph nodes.... Any advice would be appreciated....

                I have had some weird things happening in a year. I have seen a ton of doctors...  About a year and a half ago, I experienced something similar with a node on the right preocciptal side of neck. I began experiencing the fevers, sweats, weight loss, tinnitus, and floaters. I was in the ER three times and admitted twice with ZERO outcome of a diagnosis other than unknown. They ran a variety of various bloodwork for autoimmune and viral tests like Epstein-Barr, Julien-Barait, lupus, Lyme, Brucellosis, etc. all were negative. It was a CT of my neck that revealed the thyroid nodules. Things seemed to calm down for a slight period, but then the summer hit and a cervical lymph node on my left side has slowly become reactive. My CBC bloodwork has supposedly come back normal but my WBC counts have come back somewhat low. 

The level 5 neck node (posterior triangle node) that is reactive now is painless, except I have been experiencing a feeling of dysphagia or tightness around my throat and where the lymph node is located... I haven't been losing a ton of weight this time, but I have been more tired. Further, I am concerned because I believe this chain drains my thyroid, and I have been concerned about developing thyroid cancer due to the numerous nodules I have in my thyroid. The dysphagia has been very unsettling and is a constant feeling. My doctor has told me that it is idiopathic (termed ""globus"") and stress related and has prescribed Xanax, but it doesn't help. The node measures 1.1x0.4x0.6 cm, and appeared to have normal flow in October when it was ultrasounded. Since then, the node feel that it has gotten larger and my doctor feels that it is still no concern and scheduled another ultrasound to look tomorrow. He did offer to excise the node with full anesthesia, but refuses FNA despite it being just under the skin surface. 

Should I be concerned for lymphoma? Can the cervical lymph nodes be that large and normal in the neck despite the cutoff size of 0.7cm^3? I am really concerned because this thing has been swollen for a long time, and my doctors have been pretty condescending.

                Alright, so a little background:  about six months ago, I was sitting at my desk in my home office and somehow, I discovered a little rubbery bump on the inside of my arm near the elbow.  Upon further self-examination, I found I had the same rubbery bump on the inside of my other elbow.  They're both somewhat rubbery and movable.  I'd say both are each size of an ear bud off of a pair of in-ear headphones.

I went to a local walk-in clinic and the doctor there felt them and said they were lipomas.  He prescribed me some antibiotics for a sinus infection.  The bumps have stayed the same size.

Fast forward to about a month ago (two months after I found the bumps by my elbows), I was laying down on my couch at home and was rubbing the area about halfway between my shoulder and neck and I came across a very hard lump that almost seems to be sitting on top of my trapezius muscle, or whatever the muscle is called between the neck and shoulder.  Again, upon further self-examination, I feel the same very hard lump in what seems the same exact spot on the opposite shoulder area.

At first, I really had to dig deep to feel the bumps...hunching my shoulders does helped me find the bumps easier before.  Now, I can think I feel them when my shoulders are relaxed.  Am I being paranoid?

                All of this has to fit together somehow. I currently have rheumatoid arthritis (RA), Congestive Heart Failure (CHF), COPD, and a few others.

My current problems have been bothering me for about a month and don't seem to change or migrate at all, and I realize that some (like the fatigue) are also related to diseases I have. Problems include: extreme fatigue; pain in rib cage bones; pain under right front rib cage; swollen right side lymph nodes from hip up, into right armpit, also makes a thick 'line' across chest, and are swollen at right clavicle. Have had low-grade fevers (1.5 - 2 degrees) almost daily. No appetite for several months but no weight loss (in obese category).
I would love some help with this, as it's hard to get my GP, wonderful as he is, to put it all together. Thanks so much for your help!

                I tested positive in the US at the Igenex lab for Lyme Disease in 1995 but never received treatment here in Canada...now many years later I am have many lymphoma symptoms and I am having a biopsy on a groin node on March 24th. I have many symptoms including weight loss,no appetite nausea night sweats, swollen lymph nodes in my neck, groin, armpits n cheek...I am exhausted all the time and suffer from daily headache...could this be lymphoma or lyme or both...have anyone with Lyme disease been diagnosed with lymphoma?

                I was recently in the hospital for severe stomach and chest pains. Blood work shows 

WBC at 13.1 - x10E3/UL (Range: 3.4 - 10.8),
Neutrophils (Absolute) 9.7 (Range: 1.4 - 7.0), 
C Reactive Protein 14.1 - MG/L (Range: 0.0 - 4.9), 
Monocytes (Absolute) 1.1 - X10E3/UL (Range: 0.1 -0.9), 
Neutrophils 74%, 
Lymphs 16.

I am waiting for another CBC test, but when I looked over my last 3 for the past year, I noticed that all of the values listed above were changing consistently. Meaning, if it was going down, it keeps going down, and vice versa.

The above values were tested once the day I was about to go into the hospital, and again the next day in the hospital.

My primary doctor said that the trends I see with the values changing don't mean anything since values change all the time, and is telling me that the tests basically mean nothing more than some sort of inflammation, and to get my back injection for pain. 

I could see the values changing argument if they were fluctuating, but they don't seem to be, they just keep going the same direction. 

Considering my age (44), and current health isn't that great to start with (Heart Issues, Enlarged Prostate), and that with everything else being equal, the numbers point to possible Leukemia, or other serious conditions, the numbers above are concerning to me. My doctor told me that a hematologist probably wouldn't even see me with these numbers. 

Is this generally true? Or is seeking a specialist a good idea?

Thanks

                I have noticed two large lymph nodes.  one directly under my right jaw...it feels big, like half the size of my thumb.  The other is directly under my right collar bone (infraclavicular),  The collarbone one is smaller, maybe the size of a large peanut.  Both are moveable.  The trouble is, I have no idea what it means when i hear ""rubbery"" vs ""hard"".  I can't really tell the difference, to be honest.  I have an appointment with my Dr, but not for another week.  I guess I am just looking for some advice until then.  Has anyone else felt lumps like this?

                hi, i'm a 13 year old girl, and after having a sore throat for about a week (it's just now getting much better), i began looking up possibilities as to why it would hurt that long, and Leukemia popped up a lot.
now my throat's getting better, but after researching Leukemia more (the sore throat brought it to light), i've noticed that i have a lot of the symptoms, including:
the red spots over the body (petechiae), i have them on my shoulders, arms, legs, back, etc.
unexplained bruises in places like my back or the back of my knee where i would never bruise
i get breathless easily after doing activities like running, dancing, etc.
i'm always having pain on the left side of my stomach where my spleen is, the pain varies from sharp pains to dull aches
speaking of aches, my joints including my arm joints, leg joins, etc. hurt or ache a lot 
i have night sweats, i wake up and i'm drenched
i lose my appetite very easily and rarely eat, i usually only eat one full meal a day...
my gums bleed randomly! i don't touch them at all and i'll taste blood in my mouth, and they bleed whenever i brush my teeth, even if i do it with the utmost care and gentleness!
i also have a red, flaky rash all over my scalp, neck, behind the ears and around my nose, not sure if this is a symptom but i felt like i should mention it.

so do you guys think i have it? or is something else wrong?  i don't want it to get worse but i don't want to seem like a crybaby who wants attention either, also, how would i get my mom to take me to the doctor? i feel like if i told her all of my symptoms and suggested Leukemia she'd think i was being a drama queen... please help me!  :(

I am an athlete, and ever since I had the initial sickness (flu like feeling) 2 years ago I have never been the same. My stool has changed, it is flaky, and breaks up whenever it hits water, and I get diarrhea a few times a week. I am super fatigued very often also. I have also developed recurring beaus lines in my toe nails, and they have become thin, which they never were before. My performance in my sport has never been the same since my lymph nodes have swelled, feeling constantly tired while working out, and my performance has leveled out and my improvement is small. My blood values are normal, but I do not feel right, something is wrong in my body. Everyone just acts like it is no big deal, but I want to feel better. The doctor writes me off because I am young and fit and am too young to be sick. I do not feel well. My lymph nodes if anything have stayed the same size, some in my groin have matted together.

                Hi,
Every morning for about 6mths, I have had swelling in nodes in my neck, it would usually go down during the day, and return the next day all over again.
For about a year I have had a persistant non productive dry cough, figured it was smokers cough, had a chest xray, all clear, not even signs of infection or emphesema. But still cant explain cough. Bare with me now, there is more sorry...
Now, after blood test, which has in the past been normal, it is showing a sudden iron deficency anemia, even took dr by surprise.
Also, my morning swollen nodes in my neck, between chin and ear, are more or less perminant, worse in the morning still, but don't seem to go down. They are only visably seen slightly in the morning, but I know my body, they are staying enlarged during the day.
Symptims of fatigue, not tired, just exhaustion by midday, and haveto just lie down, constant feeling of being hot alllll the time, even in air conditioning, I feel like I have a fever, everyone who touches me, or whom I touch, say I am too hot. I sweat at night but not drenching, and can only sleep under a sheet, even in winter, and I kick this off also, regardless if we have the bedroom airconditioner on. my appetite has wained a little, I get hungry, but just don't feel like eating, plus when I do eat, I get full quickly.. no obvious weight loss, but I never weigh myself so not really sure.
And now it is getting a little sore to swallow. Sore around my ears (just below ears near jaw)
I also am getting quite itchy, mainly arms, to the point I will break the skin, and now my foot will itch grrr, very annoying indeed.

Does Lymphoma of any sort cause iron deficient anemia?
Are any of my symptoms worth telling the dr to look or test me for any kind of lymphoma?

I am just a bit worried is all, any opinions/advice would be great.
I go back to my Dr in a couple of weeks.

Thanks
Lee.

                For several months (nearing on a year, actually) I've had a severe decline in health and considering my age (about to be 25) that seemed a little odd. We'll skip past the boring months of not getting any answers for any symptoms and head to what brought me here.

I was treated for cellulitis by an ER doc when this pain in my back was so bad after coughing it brought me to my knees. I showed them my swollen lymph node that had been persisting for several months and spoke of the other symptoms. They checked my urine for kidney stones, but when they wasn't present they found a mild UTI and the presence of cellulitis in the crease between my groin and leg. So, they gave me bactrim and muscle relaxers for my back (they had no clue about that) and told me follow up with a GP for the lymph node if it hadn't gone down after the antibiotic treatment. (the cellulitis is completely cleared and not a problem anymore)

That was 2 months ago. I went to the doc today and followed up about it, mentioned my other symptoms (terrible night sweats, missed period last month, a persistent cough in the morning & at night, chest pains, constant dizziness) (no more bruises and I've gained 10lbs of the 30lbs I had suddenly lost bcz I'm working out now)

She checked my neck and breathing, stomach etc, and noted the ""2cm mass, suspected LN"" that was visible & she felt-  and became a lot more vague and quiet after that. We scheduled an ultrasound for my pelvic wall which is tomorrow and took a bunch of blood and some urine. Said they were doing a CBC, CRP, (some others I can't remember), checking for TB (bcz of the night sweats) and my urine to test my kidney function. 

So.....to my question....I know my symptoms are close to that with lymphoma...but I don't think I took that very seriously until today...with the manner my doc ordered all the tests and her instance at seeing me back to go over results kinda shook me a little. Should I be worried? Are they just doing due diligence and I'm just too nervous? What else could she be looking for?

                Well for beginners I'm 20 years old , for the most part healthy. A week from today I had a very painful lymph node between my jaw and ear like where the partoid gland is. I went to urgent care the doctor said he felt it was a bit swollen .. I asked him if it could be cancer as I had no cold or anything of the sort..he said it's highly unlikely.. At most I had a runny nose.. I later realized I had a couple blisters in my mouth due to herpes .. (I have herpes 1). Two days later the pain subsided and I went to the doctors again and it was a different Doctor than my gp. She said all my lymph nodes were fine and I told her to feel in the exact spot  I was having pain in.. She said it was swollen but just slightly bigger than the other side .. I mentioned my symptoms to her how I always wake up tired and feel tired throughout the day.. She said it was most likely my sleeping schedule as it doesn't have a set time . She said not to worry that it's not cancer.. I also got worked up and went to the E.R cause I was experiencing a bit of pain in the same spot .. The doctor told me the same thing as the others that I shouldn't worry because it's most likely not cancer .. She did a complete blood count and came back in and told me my blood test look great .. Now I'm sitting here with a pain that comes and goes in the same area .. What are the chances of this being lymphoma ?

                This is not a question but a sharing. In 2005,
my husband was diagnosed with non-Hodgkins
lymphoma based upon history, physical, blood
work, imaging including pet scan and then
biopsy. A second opinion on the biopsy 
was done. At the time of diagnosis, he was
anemic, had a massively enlarged spleen,
Pet Scan showed cancer also in his bones
and lymph nodes. He had begun taking 
Prilosec and began eating red grapes daily.
As we were preparing to go to a cancer
center, we noticed his spleen decreasing
in size and his blood work improved. Another
pet scan was done confirming reduction in
spleen size. We cancelled plans to go to
cancer center and adopted a wait and see
approach. To make a long story short, his
condition has dramatically improved with
no need for chemo etc.

                I am 21 years old. Recently I got sick and took antibiotics I had a fever and sore throat. I also have a wisdom tooth that needs to come out my cheek is slightly swollen and my ear hurts occasionally. I am going to get that out next week. I have been feeling my neck a lot and I noticed a swelling along the sternocleidomastoid muscle on the bottom. There seems to be a slight swelling and I am not sure if it's because of my wisdom teeth and my lymph nodes are acting up or if there's something major going on. I don't know if I should stop worrying but it's so difficult I have a lot of anxiety when it comes to my health. I've been losing weight from stressing about my wisdom teeth surgery and all my swelling in my neck and lymph nodes. Please if something had the same happen to them or just any insight would be great. Thank you

                Hi everyone..I was wondering if someone could help me understand my CT results...

The main thing that sticks out to me is that it says ""the largest left neck node involves the left Ia station measuring 
13 x 8 mm. Previously it measured 11 x 10 mm."" 

This test was just performed on Feb 4, 2016. They compared it to previous scans done on the same area from Nov 2014 and April 2014. The last sentence reads ""Overall, these lymph nodes are stable to perhaps marginally more prominent from prior study.""

My doctor said he wasn't concerned at all about the sizing and to see him in 6 months. Im wondering if these sizes are ""normal"" or should I worry and pursue other options? Thanks for your help everyone!

To feel the lump you have to push up under the chin near the neck, and then it pops out.  I'm able to move the lump to my jawline.  It's very, very mobile.  I've had swollen lymph nodes before but never anything like this.  It is not painful just tender and slightly uncomfortable.  I also have a canker sore in my mouth on the same side as it, I don't know if this could be related but felt I should mention it anyways.  Normally, something like this would not bother me so much, but my father was diagnosed with lymphoma about five months ago so it has me concerned.  He had a lump on his neck and that is how he discovered it.

                Hi, I'm a 32 year old male with a question. About 2 weeks ago, I noticed a slight lump when I was massaging my neck during a bad tension headache. I had sever sinus issues at that time. The lump cant be seen and is very small, like a half inch. And it's right in the groove between my mastoid and the angle of my jaw. It's painless, and I can even move it around. It's not rock hard and is squishy and feels like it's under a bunch of stuff. I feel no numbness or tingling. I went to an urgent care facility after work one night and the provider checked me out and said nothing really jumped out at him as swollen. Did bloodwork on  me and results for the CBC and Sed Rate came back normal. I called and asked about lymphoma or leukemia and they said that pretty much the counts would have to be abnormal and they didnt see any red flags in the blood work.I feel I have a similar structure on the other side, and again, I'm going through no pain or numbness.  I've been obsessed with this the past couple weeks and I'm definately getting an appointment set up with my doc. What prompted me to get obsessed with cancer is I have a few bright red pin prick dots on my arms, but the provider said they didnt look like anything to worry about. I did some reading and read about this maybe being my transverse process of my vertebra or the tail portion of the parotid gland that can be felt. I just wanted some opinions so I can be more informed for my apointment. I appreciate it.

                I found a pea size lump on my right side of neck in between my ear and collar bone but more close to collar bone. It does not hurt when I touch it but I have been touching it too much it causes the area to hurt. When I feel it it feels like it's on my neck muscle. I'm scared of what it could be. It's giving me anxiety and I just want to know if anyone else has had this or knows what it could be. I felt this a couple days ago I'm not sure how long I've had it but I did come down with a cold a couple days ago and a fever etc and I also had minor ear pain and my wisdom tooth seems to be a bit inflamed I can tell on my cheek. It might be from that but not sure.  I'm taking antibiotics for the last couple days but ts still here. Not sure what to do I want to stop worrying.

                I recently had a CT of my neck done.  I have been sick for a year, with swollen lymph nodes for 8 months out of that year.  I am confused by the measurement of the lymph nodes.  I was wondering if someone could explain if I should be concerned by the size or if these are still considered normal. 
Here are the sizes of the lymph nodes in my neck.  Are they considered large enough to biopsy? Also medically speaking what does borderline enlarged lymph nodes mean?
1.2cm  longitudinally and 1cm in AP dimension
1.7 cm  longitudinally  and 9mm in AP dimension
1.8 cm longitudinally and 9mm in AP dimension
1.6 cm longitudinally and 1.5 cm dimension.

                I have a single lump on the right side of the neck, just below the hyoid bone.
Its there for more than 2 months now and the first Ultrassonography I made showed nothing at all.

It feels like a bone that is off its place, and when I swallow it goes up and down with everything else.

Is this considered a mobile lump? It just move on swallowing.

It doesn't seem to hurt her but with her always being sick and fevers and she doesn't ever seem to gain weight and doesn't eat very much. She's a lot more pale then the other kids in school.

                Hi. Thanks to anyone that has read this. Within the last year I haven't been feeling right. i going swollen lymph nodes on each side of my neck months ago. Then found one behind my right jaw underneath my ear. That one is very hard. Not moveable and seems to be getting bigger. Had an ultrasound that showed 3 that were about 1.5-2cm. 3 without ecogenic hilum. The ultrasound report said they can not be sonographicallly characterized as benign. So they did an FNA on the two largest. Came out benign. Right before the biopsy one had also become enlarged in the back of my neck. I'm seeing a different doc now and he doesn't understand why the hard one wasn't biopsied so I am going to go for that soon. As far as symptoms, I am exhausted and weak. Had a headache about 2 months back that lasted for 3 weeks straight, now it's a few times a week. Have had side pain behind my left ribs and below for 3 months straight. Now it's on and off. Can't eat much without feeling incredibly full, for at least 6 or more hours afterward. Have stomach pain and diarrhea. And have recently had upper stomach pain where. I can't ly in my stomach.  In October i lost 10 pounds in 2 weeks without trying. I am again starting to drop weight. I have had night sweats on and off for a long time and they are now constant every night. I can't seem to get comfortable even throughout the day. I either feel like it's 100 degrees or I have chills. My CBC showed elevated WBC. It was 11.2 and about a month later increased to 12.8. I've been having chronic eye infections for about a year as well as chronic yeast infection every month. I've been tested for Lyme, mono, HIV, Syphiliis (which I new would both come out negative) all negative. Thyroid is normal. Now I'm being sent for a chest X-ray as well as the second biopsy. It gets very frustrating always feeling like garbage. I am starting to become worried and my doc suggested that if we can't figure it out I should maybe see a hematologist. Has anyone been through this contellation of symptoms? The hard node is what is very concerning to me.

I've had 3 lymph nodes in my neck which have been palpable for at least 2 years. 

My doctor felt them about 2 years ago and said they were fine and that's been that.

However since having my son 6 months ago I've become very anxious about them. They are about 1cm in size possibly ever so slightly smaller. The last 2 weeks I've had a few night sweats where I've had big wet rings on my nightdress. 

I suffer from bad anxiety for which I take medication so it may be my anxiety taking over.

My question here is could it be that kind of cancer (because as from what the doctor said it doesn't come in the maxillary bone) If yes then how bad it is?

                A little over a year ago, I discovered three small lumps in my neck.  I started to get anxious about them, so I decided to go to the doctors.  He said that I had a few slightly enlarged posterior cervical lymph nodes and they were probably due to a recent cold or virus.  A few months later they were still around the same size so I went back.  He told me they were around 1cm (though they felt larger to me) and that I should keep an eye on them to see if they get larger, and that sometimes they can become permanently enlarged.  Well, it's been over a year and as far as I can tell, they haven't gotten any larger, but I can still easily feel them.

The thing that bothers me is that I read about this particular lymph node group, and almost every site I look at says that if the Posterior Lymph Nodes become enlarged, it is commonly due to malignancies, leukemia, or lymphoma.

I am a 25 year old male.  I've had no fever, night sweats, or any other symptom besides the lymph nodes.  I've had blood work done on two separate occasions, which have both been fine.  I've also had a monospot, HIV test, and TB test, also OK.  

I've just had a bit of anxiety lately, and have grown a little concerned over this.

Any advice would be helpful.

Thanks!

                I am a 26 year old young woman that would like som help concerning lymph nodes please.

About 7 weeks ago, for a week and a half, I had daily night fevers that only came at night and night fevers, but they went away after a week-week and a half.  The doctors tested me for a bunch of infections but everything came back negative; I had no sore throat, no sinus issues, no cough, no ear issues, etc. so it was a mystery but went away.

About 5 weeks ago, I had a suddenly really bad back pain, and I was massaging my neck tans upper back when I discovered 2 large raised lymph nodes in the back of neck, near cervical line. After a few excruciating days of bad back pain/hardly being able to walk, I went to the walk in..she was a little concerned of my lower back pain and the 2 raised lymph nodes. I did a back X-ray and there showed nothing wrong but I did an ultrasound, and it showed 3 lymph nodes in my neck 6mm (so luckily not over 1cm) and to repeat the ultrasound in 4 weeks.

I did blood work, and it just showed a little lower white blood cells but nothing else significant. I was feeling around my neck  in other parts I hadn't felt before 2 weeks later, and I found 2 more lymph nodes near collarbone beside supraclavicular, I think posterior or anterior?(felt a little bigger). I decided to do the ultrasound a little earlier and then went back to my doctor when she called me with the results.

There were several behind my neck on the right still, the largest measuring 1cm but they looked benign in nature. The 2 of my left, near collarbone/neck area, though were hypo-echoic, had increased vascularity, both measured 1.5cm and were suspicious for pathologic lymph nodes.

My doctor wants me to do a biopsy in a few weeks but I was wondering if anyone can tell me what ""hypoechoic and increased vascularity and suspicious for lymph nodes""  means exactly?

I'm glad we're following up as my amazing 56 year old mom, died of cancer this year, so it's just better to be safe than sorry. I haven't gotten any more night sweats or night fevers since 7-8 weeks ago, have no other infection, no sore throat, etc. and my only other symptoms are increased fatigue and increased itchiness.

If anyone can provide some insight, that would be much appreciated, thank you!

                Sir , i m having lymph node in my left neck around supravicular region. Yesterday i did ultrasound sound and the size was 1*0.4*1cm. It is palable. It was first time felt in june 20, 2015 while i was having bath. It was after 1 week of i m in car accident. I was having pain and little wound in my head. I went to hospital and they did CAT scan and there was no blooding inside a head. Everything was fine. They say i had bad sinus and they gave me antibiotic for a week that was 875 mg. Then i m having direhha. Within almost 6 month i did CBC test 4 time everyhing fine and normal. In this period i took some antibiotic for my lymph node. But it is not going to its normal size. I m having watery tools from 4 month thats not diarehha. 

Latest size of my lymph node is 1*0.4*1 cm. I donot think so that it is getting bigger in size. But  i feel it soft. I feel it sometime bigger and sweeling , some time small in size. May be i m wrong. My stomach is crying too much. I can eat good ,sleep good. I donot have any kind of classical symptoms except i m often feeling whole body pain. I m working 11 hours everyday for 5 days. 

One more thing is i was found vitamin d deficient in may. I was having vitamin d from 4 month. Last week i did my vitamin d 25 hydroxy test . Vitamin d level was 37 ng/ml. 
Still i m having 4000 iu everday. My calcium serum level is 10.2 mg. My all cholestrol, ldl,triglycyrin all are high. 

I m 32 years old. Within 5 month i gain 10 pound evev i m in stress and worry. Do u think i have lymphoma or non hodgkin lymphoma?

                Hello, all! I haven't posted to MedHelp in years. And I'm not sure if I'm posting this in the right place. But it's worth a try because I'm really seeking some advice. I've exhausted all of my family and friends - who told me I should get online and try to find some support groups that can help - which is how I wound up here. 

I am a mother of three young boys. I'm in my 30's. 1 1/2 to 2 years ago, I started getting a severe itch. It feels like a deep itch inside my body that I can't ever scratch. I've had kidney stones in the past, so I figured it just might be a kidney issue and that my body wasn't filtering enough - thus the itch. I'm also having terrible, drenching night sweats. I'm actually sweaty all the time (I'm hot and sweaty when everyone else around me is cold), but the nights are the worst. I wake up wet. And then, about two months ago, I noticed a hard lump behind my ear. It seemed to just ""pop up"" out of nowhere. It started out the size of a pencil eraser and has grown to about the size of a marble. It's rock hard and painless and doesn't move around. 

My doctor thought the lump must be a cyst or some type of bone mass because it was so hard. So she sent me to get some imaging done. The ultrasound showed that it is a swollen lymph node. It's not very large (only about 1 cm) and the ultrasound findings said it has internal vascularity (which I have no idea what that means - it's just what it says on my chart). At that time (about 3 weeks ago), my doctor told me to just continue to keep an eye on it. But to contact her again in a couple of weeks if it was still there and still hard.

About a week after I had the first ultrasound, I noticed another hard lump behind my other ear. It was smaller than the first one - about the size of a pencil eraser. But also rock hard and immovable. The next day, I found yet another lump - this one down further, on my neck. It's not as rock hard as the first two, but it's larger. 

So I went back in to see my doctor (internist) and she told me I needed to get the first one biopsied. She ordered the biopsy and I scheduled it.

I went in for the biopsy yesterday and it was the worst experience! My internist had ordered an ultrasound guided needle biopsy. I got to the office, spent an hour filling out paperwork and 30 minutes waiting for the radiologist to come in and perform the biopsy. The nurse did another ultrasound while I was waiting. Then the doctor comes in (he had no bedside manner) and tells me he won't do a biopsy because my lump is less than an inch and he isn't comfortable doing it and that ""it's probably nothing serious anyway."" (My doctor told me that only way to find out if ""it's something serious"" is by having an actual biopsy done!). The radiologist made me feel like I was stupid and that my husband and I were wasting his time by being there. He said things like, ""I'm not comfortable doing a biopsy when it's not large"" and ""I could poke your ear if I biopsy it."" Even though my internist thinks I should have it done and is concerned with how long I've had the nodes, how rock hard they are and my other symptoms. 

I actually have a friend who is going through treatment right now for lymphoma and she told me that a needle biopsy isn't even a good option if it is cancer or lymphoma because if it's cancer in the lymph nodes, a needle biopsy could spread it and they don't get a great sample that way, anyway. She recommended that I go see a doctor who would just remove the entire lump. 

I guess my question is this: do you think I'm warranted and justified in wanting to get a second opinion? My husband and I are both feeling that we should. My dad died of cancer when he was 49 and my mom also had cancer, so it's obviously something I don't take lightly and would like to nip in the bud if I have it. And if I don't have it - then AWESOME! But isn't the only way to find out if I have a biopsy done? 

Is it normal to not do a biopsy when a node is less than an inch? Is it normal to just ""wait and see"" if it gets larger? It's already been a few months. I don't know if it's gotten larger (it feels like it has), but it definitely has't gotten smaller and two more have sprung up since. 

Oh - and also, I have rheumatoid arthritis and have taken the medication Enbrel for 14 years and just RECENTLY (like a couple of weeks ago) read that autoimmune diseases and the DMARDS (like Enbrel) that treat them can cause lymphoma. So I'm a BIT worried about that too.

Anyway, that's my story. I've been in a frustrated funk yesterday and today because my husband and I were so excited and grateful to just get some answers yesterday by having the biopsy done. Only to have it turn out to be a big waste of time.

Anyone have any thoughts? 

Thanks so much in advance. I'm glad I found a website where I can talk to others. :)

                I guess I just need to vent, I apologize if thats frowned upon but I must. Im PISSED! Im tired of being scared, its exhausting. I naturally am very anxious and fearful so this ordeal is taking its toll on me and my family. About a year ago I was diagnosed with a borderline enlarged spleen after from abdominal pain, confirmed by ultrasound and CT. Doctor didn't seem concerned at all and nothing was ever done. Two months ago I go in for my yearly check up and mention that my spleen is still bothering me, get another ultrasound and this time its considered enlarged14.1 cm I believe up from 13.4 last year. Now all of a sudden my doc is concerned and wants all these tests, blood smears, etc...lots of stuff that look for cancer. After a week wait for Mayo results she calls and says they look encouraging and do not suggest cancer like lymphoma or Leukemia but wants me to see a hematologist/oncologist just to see if there is anything to look at. Instantly my panic comes back. WHY, if she says it doesn't suggest cancer then why?? SO I have a follow up appointment Tuesday and he again tells me that she no longer suspects cancer, she just wants a specialist who deals with blood and spleens regularly, to take a look. Once again I feel at ease, I can smile again. Fast forward to this morning....I see the dreaded cancer doctor who is conveniently located IN the cancer center. Oh hello nerves...youre back again I see. After roughly an hour of waiting I see her for maybe 10 minutes if im lucky at which time she tells me that my blood work looks good, red, white, platelets etc but that really doesn't mean much and I will need a CT scan, bone scan, marrow biopsy etc etc. WHAAAT? So I say ""hey, my doc said cancer was no longer suspected, my cells in the smear looked normal, why are you going right back to cancer""??? No real answer was given to me, just told that my blood tests don't signal any bone marrow involvement, lymphoma is a treatable disease, and we will call you when we get the scan appointments made. Now why in the hell would she be talking about lymphoma and bone marrow involvement etc if she WASNT suspecting cancer? Im sick, literally sick over this. Yes, im well aware that there are others already dealing with diagnosis and treatments etc but the not knowing, the tests, the waiting....its terrifying. PLEASE...anybody...thoughts? Stories, experiences...im begging..as I sit and look at my 9 and 3 year old playing....what is happening to me :'(

                Hi,
This seems to be a somewhat common post, but I haven't yet seen any conclusion to these type of symptoms.  Basically the situation is about 5 months ago I started feeling some strange sensations in my tooth, which later developed into a sore throat and low-grade fever, gum pain (on and off) and later started developing pain in my groin.  After some paranoia over a sexual encounter (unprotected oral sex)  I started searching for lymph nodes on other parts of my body.  Shortly after that I started developing pain in my armpits and neck, along with tightness in my lower neck at times.  There are no visible lumps, just pain where lymph nodes should be.  This went on for a couple of months and then subsided a bit.  I was given a couple of courses of antibiotics, but I'm not sure if they helped or the symptoms just calmed down.  The groin thing never went away completely but was more mild.  A few weeks ago the symptoms started coming back with pain in my armpits, neck and groin, nothing obviously swollen, but I've been told they could be swollen under the skin.  Sometimes I get pain in other areas where lymph nodes could be (behind the knees, elbows), also accompanied by a slight sore throat and ear ache.  I recently went to the doctor again for another look and she ""thinks"" a few are swollen, but seemed kind of unsure.  They took some blood and urine and are in the process of running a battery of tests.  I have already tested negative for HIV, but am testing for that again as part of the tests.  I am waiting on the results for all of these tests.  As a side note, I also went to the dentist during this time and have many cavities that need to be treated.

My questions are:
1) Does this sound like any kind of Lymphoma or cancer?  I've read that nodes are usually painless and generally start in one area and not all over, but my doctor said they could be painful in the beginning.  
2) Could dental problems (cavities) be causing these symptoms?  I've been told they can only cause lymph node swelling in the neck, but I still feel like this is somehow related to my teeth problems.
3) If my blood work comes back clean, is this a pretty good sign it's not cancer or lymphoma?  I don't have insurance and can see some very expensive testing coming if nothing conclusive comes from the test.  My doctor has already asked me to get an ultrasound.

Any ideas on what this could be would be helpful.  I'm trying to get through the weekend without being overwhelmed with anxiety.

Thank you!

                We have discovered mulitple enlarged lymph nodes on my 2 year old son, with some the size of a pea. He is having alot of episodes of severe sweating from his neck up, where we need to change his shirt or the sheet in his bed is saturated. He does complain of belly pain, where I need to rub his belly. He also complains of leg pain at times where I need to rub his leg or give him Tylenol. My husband was diagnosed with CLL in 2005 and has had 7 rounds of chemo. At one time blood work did not show that his small remission period was over, but his CT scan did show lymph nodes to be enlarged. Should I be concerned? CLL is a older adult disease, but there again my husband was diagnosed at the age of 47.

                My 8 year old has had 24 colds in 13 months. We started seeing an immunologist because I have thought he is immune compromised. 
His blood in May was pretty normal except for a high wbc which it was done about 6 days after a minimal operation. 
Fast forward to October. 
WBC and rbc in range but both on low end. Neutrophils are only 36 and lymphs 55. Absolute lymphs were 4.1.  Ok so doc offered more bw.  

Got new panels. WBC. Within range but low end. Very low. Rbc within range but on the low end. 

Neutrophils 35
 Lymphs 54 
Monocytes 9 
Cd 8 pos lymphs 17.3 low. 

He has had chronic colds that come
With a fever that can last a while and then return. As soon as he is on the mend he gets knocked back down again. And now again he is sick. He has been pulled from school due to the excessive illnesses in September alone. He had had swollen nodes in his neck for a while. Lately he has complained about headaches and leg pain but not a lot. Also develops a
Reddish rash. 

Is it time to call a hematologist? I'm starting to worry more. I am waiting for our ped to call. We got back to the immunologist on Monday. Any info is greatly appreciated. 
Neutrophils are supposed to be higher then that right?

                About 4 months ago I noticed a little bit of swelling on the back side of my neck. Then two weeks later swelling in my armpits, chest, stomach and then inner thighs.(groin)  No bumps or pain just swelling.  My GP did blood tests all normal except iron was low. I was seeing a hematologist for iron deficient anemia last year  so I went back  to see him. I told him what I was experiencing., also pain in my neck/stomach after consuming alcohol. I also have joint pain and fatigue, rash and  weakness. He did a CT scan of neck, chest and pelvis all normal except for  ""Scotty"" nodes that were .5cm in my neck. He said all was normal and that I didn't seem swelled. Then I experienced swelling in my upper arms and can feel a slight bump on each side. I have increased joint pain and Carole tunnel type stuff in my wrists/hands so My GO referred me to a rheumatologist who did a ANA test which came back high tier positive, but all other blood work came back normal. She diagnosed me with incomplete lupus. I just can't make sense of the pain I still get when drinking alcohol it is in all the same places plus my jaw..basically where I am swelled. The Drs have said there is nothing to biopsy..and one even said ""the good thing if it is cancer it will grow"" I'm so sick of playing the waiting game and let's make her think she's crazy!? Does this sound like lymphoma or am I really crazy?!

                Hi everyone,

I sit here in a very frustrated and fragile state because I cannot get answers.  I have bounced through 4 doctors and multiple ER/Urgent cares in the last 6 months trying to find out what is wrong with me.  Here is my story:

My health issues started about 6 months ago.  I came down with a bad illness and had a fever/respiratory issues/swollen lymph nodes/headache/stomach pain/muscle and join aches/extreme night sweats (absolutely drenched)/weakness, etc.  This illness lasted nearly a month!  I was unable to really work or do anything for nearly a month.  I saw a couple different doctors.  My labs were are normal, and I was tested for the usual infections of Mono, TB, HIV, etc.  Everything came back fine.  Doctors told me it was a virus and I would be better.

Eventually I improved, but still had lingering symptoms such as daily pain behind my knees/armpits/calves etc.  I have had 3 other random 'infections' since that major one.  They usually last about a week and will be a low-grade fever/muscle aches, swollen lymph nodes/extreme fatigue, etc.  Basically over the last 6 months I have not felt well.  Even when I am not going through an infection I just feel 'off'.

Things have progressed recently.  About 3.5 weeks ago I started to get another infection.  It was like the others, but this time the headache was worse.  I was in bed for about a week, and started to improve.  Most of the symptoms went away except for the headaches and the minor lymph node aches that I always have.  However, about 1 week after the infection I came down with the worst headaches of my life.  Ive had migranes/tension headaches in the past, and this pain was FAR FAR worse.  I was able to hold off for a couple days, but by the 3rd day my head felt like it was going to EXPLODE.  This was the worst pain of my life, so I went to the ER.  The first ER turned me away with 'tension headache' diagnosis.  A day later I went to a new ER and they gave me a CT and MRI and both were negative, which is good.

This head pain was really brutal.  My head felt like it was going to explode.  It improved a little day by day, and now about 10 days after the peak, it is at a 3/10 daily instead of a 10/10.  However, I am also having other major problems.  I really haven't gotten out of bed the last 10 days.  Extreme fatigue, weight loss of 6% of my body weight.  Adbominal pain on both my left and right side (under ribs and also lower).  Have pain in my nodes all over my body, and the night sweats have come back.  The last week or so Ive had drenching night sweats.  I also have petechiae on my arms.  I had some blood drawn and I have a massive bruise/petechiae on my arm as a result.  Also have 4 bruises on my legs and all Ive been doing is laying in bed.

So I have ALL of these symptoms and feel really ******.  Again, have not been able to work.  Was at another Dr. this week and had a CBC, Rheumatoid Factor, Comprehensive Metabolic Panel w/EGFR,  SED Rate, RPR, Chlamydia, HIV test.  I also had a chest x-ray.  All were normal.  

I am extremely frustrated and want to find out what is going on with me.  Should I demand that I am referred to an Oncologist so I can get a Pet scan?  I don't know what to do and am very sick, so if anyone has any help it would be greatly appreciated.

                My mother (57+ yrs) is under treatment for Hypothyroidism, Hypertension, Osteo Arthritis & Osteoporosis. We have recently performed a few periodic tests for her results of which are as follows -

CBC
===
Hb - 10.6 [12.5-16.0]
Haematocrit - 33.5 [37-47]
RBC - 3.59 [4.2-5.4]
MCV - 93 [78-100]

ESR - 52 [0-30]

Misc
====
Serum Creatinine - 1.0 [0.6-1.1]
TSH - 1.76 [0.35-4.94]
FBS - 91 [60-100]
PPBS - 94 [70-140]
HbA1c - 4.8 [4.5-5.6]
Cholesterol Total - 155 [< 200]
Triglycerides - 114 [ 60]
LDL Cholesterol - 97.2 [< 130]
VLDL Cholesterol - 22.8 [< 30]
Total Cholesterol/HDL Cholesterol Ratio - 4.4 [3.3-4.4]
LDL/HDL Cholesterol Ratio 2.8 [0.5-3.0]

Her BP is around 110/80.

Symptoms
========
1) Weight loss over past 6-8 months, part of which may be due to dietary changes for sugar control as advised by doctor in Dec, 2014. However, she has recently become 70.4 kg from 71 kg in past one month with her height being 5.2 ft.

2) Fatigue/tiredness since past 6-8 months although not very severe. She also had to experience some very stressful schedule due to a few hospitalizations at home.

Questions
=========
1) Her Hb is now 10.6 although in Dec, 2014 it was 11.7. Based on her available reports, can we conclude whether the anemia is due to Iron/B12 deficiency or, could there be some other problem (e.g. kidney, tumor, internal bleeding etc) ?

2) Her serum creatinine level is now 1.0 although in Dec, 2014 it was 0.8. Considering her age, weight (70.4 kg) & height (5.2 ft), is it the sign of any kidney problem ?

Our medicine doctor has advised her case as Iron/Vitamin-B12 deficiency & started her on Iron (Orofer XT for 3-months) & Vitamin-B12 (Ecod Plus to continue) medicines. Request you to kindly share your opinion on whether we are on the right track.

                Hi, I am here again looking for more advice and info. I had 20 rads to the groin in November/December of last year for stage one follicular lymphoma. In the first week of May of this year, I discovered enlarged nodes at the back of my neck. I have never had enlarged nodes anywhere but the inguinal area.I brought them to the attention of my primary doctor, who ordered an ultrasound. The ultrasound showed two nodes, side by side, measuring 1cm each. The report also stated that ""no hilum could be found"". My doctor then sent me to the hospital for an ultrasound and possible biopsy. After looking at the scan, the radiologist said that even though there is no hilum, the nodes are still too small to do anything about. He suggested re-scanning in 6 months. We then had everything brought to the attention of my oncologist, who agreed that we would just keep an eye on these new enlarged nodes, and I did not need to be seen sooner at the cancer clinic.

And the nodes are still enlarged. And getting minutely bigger.

Is this because I have an indolent form of lymphoma? There doesn't seem to be any urgency, even though they all agree the nodes are not looking right. At what size do neck nodes have to get to before they are dealt with? I guess I am having ""watch and wait"" anxiety, but who decides when something should be done? How do I know that it is not slowly, indolently growing into my bone marrow? I think that is my main question.....what size do neck nodes have to be to be considered for biopsy? My inguinal node was 3.2cm, and I think the standard is anything over 2cm in the groin needs to be looked at. Is that right?

I know this community is not made up of doctors, but I was given valuable info and advice and support last year when I was trying to get a diagnosis, so this is where I have turned to for help. Again.

After going to the doctor, she put me on antibiotics. A few days later I broke out in a horrible rash from head to toe. I then went to the emergency room where the doctor was convinced I had mono, as he explained that this rash was a result of the antibiotics in my system while having the mononucleosis virus. He suggested that I get a spot test anyways even know he was fairly confident that was what it was. A few weeks later, I got the blood test done and it came back negative, but my liver enzymes slightly higher than usual? Someone mentioned the virus could just be out of my body where I waited so late to get tested and I am feeling fairly better all the same, but I still have a slightly swollen lymph node in my neck, unexplained weight loss, no appetite, and fatigue.. Do I have a reason to think this may be Lymphoma? Is there another test I should get done?  Thanks so much.

                For nearly ten years I battled chronic myeloid leukemia until the daily chemotherapy became so toxic that I had to undergo a procedure that was a coin toss of success: a bone marrow transplant. For two years I documented, almost daily, my struggle through one of the toughest procedures man has ever conceived. My hope is that in the telling, someone else going through the same procedure can benefit. There was very little from a patient's perspective for me and even less that was valuable to call upon. Please take advantage of my story in any way you can.

                Ive been reading threads on this site for a couple of months now... but since I havent gotten anywhere with my doctors, I figured Id just make a profile in hopes of finding someone who may be able to relate.  I am a 24 year old female, suffering from extreme unexplained weight loss, major fatigue ( chalked it up to being a mom of an almost 2 year old son), loss of appetite, nodules on my thyroid and in my lungs, and multiple swollen lymph nodes in my neck. The oldest and biggest lymph node is on my right side under my jaw bone measuring just over 2 cm.. Newest one popped up about a month ago and is now 1 cm in size. I started seeing an oncologist (referred to by hospital after ER visit) who basically went from wanting to watch and measure for 3 months and run PLENTY of test.. blood work always came back normal, aside from my bilirubin levels.. CT scans showed the nodules and lymph nodes.. But no infections, no recent sickness. He was on board at this point with doing an open biopsy, as he thought FNA biopsy's never show much.. But at the next appointment suggested I changed my diet. My normal weight had always been in the 135 area. I am 5'6 and went from 165lbs when I had my son, down to 108lbs.... without ever trying to lose ANY weight. I was totally pissed with the doctor blowing me off like I was crazy and began seeing an ENT doctor. First visit he told me to come back in one month and that we would do the FNA biopsy. My family and I had gone on a nice vacation, prior to the biopsy, just in case... Fast forward a month, got the biopsy done, results a week later - negative!! I was so happy and relieved. Shortly after getting the news, he informed me that it isnt 100% and that that type of biopsy cant detect HL, amongst other possibilities. We scheduled to do an open biopsy and just a couple days after I found out that I am pregnant again.. Talk about timing!!!!! NOW I will have to wait 10 months to get what could be very bad news, so I will be anxious and thinking nonstop throughout this pregnancy. I will have to trust that everything happens for a reason, but I know that wasted time is cancers best friend. If anyone can help me, whether it be advice or kind thoughts, its all welcomed and greatly appreciate !

                Hi, I am a 21 year old female from Texas. About 6 months ago I noticed a large ball-like lump on my left groin. It wasn't painful or anything at first until a week later when I wasn't even able to barely touch it without wanting to jump out of my skin. For a while the pain would come and go in cycles. I would be in pain for 3 days then perfectly fine for a week. After a few months it began to hurt for weeks, sometimes over a month and then feel better one day out of nowhere the day after the pain is at its peak for a week or two. The swelling gets worse with the pain but not vice versa. The swelling is always there and sometimes is larger but not painful. The strange part is that it expanded! It went from a ball on my left groin to swelling on my hip, upper thigh, inner thigh, my pelvis/vaginal area, and even in my lower abdomen, all on the left side. The swelling is actually cutting off circulation to my inner leg when I lie straight on my back! The tenderness is unbearable and the pain gets extremely bad the later it becomes throughout the day. I don't even sleep at night anymore because I'm in too much pain at night time. Walking hurt, standing hurts, doing anything at all hurts and yet nothing consistent seems to make the pain nor swelling worse besides touching the swelling like from wearing underwear or slouching when I sit. My blood tests showed nothing, my ultrasound only showed many swollen lymph nodes (the largest was only 1.7cm), the gynecologist showed nothing, even the CT scan showed nothing. All I have left is a biopsy but I'm still anxious and I really don't know how to cope with the pain without even understanding what's causing it! Could I have lymphoma? I have heard it's not usually painful but I can't imagine what else is going on! I don't have any other symptoms nor have I had any since this began other than pain and swelling.

                I am 16, female, and I have been finding small light brown bruises on my legs. (Less than 20) I have one dime sized on my arm. From what I can tell it's not completely easy bleeding or bruising... My cat scratched me today and I hardly bled at all. I have bruises that I know I had gotten that have been healing. My last blood test was in December last year and came back normal. I'm a hypochondriac and I really just want this worrying to end. This is my only symptom, I see my doctor on Nov. 13. For blood test and regular check up. If you're experiencing this or could help give me peace of mind that'd be wonderful!

                Hi!, 3 days ago I started to feel a lot of pain in my armpits, then I have noticed that I have some little and strange balls in my armpits, inside the skin. I have five of these little balls in my left armpit and three of them of the other one.

I went to the hospital, but the doctor has only told me that it is some kind of allergy caused by the environment. 

I am very worried about this little balls inside my skin. Do you have any idea of what it can be? I don't know if this is some kind of reaction from my body until the pressure i feel recently from my studies

                One year ago diagnosed with fatty liver and enlarged spleen at 13.4cm. Doc didn't seem too concerned, never ordered any additional tests, told me it sometimes happens. Two weeks ago during a regular check up I tell her my spleen still hurts so she orders CBC, digestive chem panel and a US. The CBC came back perfect, chem panel perfect but the second ultrasound found spleen enlarged to 14.1, still fatty liver but now also enlarged. NOW she is scaring the BLEEP out of me with the whole ""something is going on here"" speech and ordering tests of every known kind including a blood smear, testing for proteins, Leukemia and Lymphoma, you name it! She said that cancer isn't high on the list of possibilities but its definitely ON the list. Im scared, to say the least!

                Here is an article on idiopathic splenomegaly, http://archsurg.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/full/137/1/64, it states that a majority of idiopathic(unknown origin) splenomegaly can be attributed to lymphoma. I have had an enlarged spleen for over 2 years now with no known cause. After 2 ct scans, ultrasounds, many blood tests, liver/spleen scan, hiv, hepatitis, cmv, and other tests, I have absolutely 0 answers from the doctors. So now I am going to push for a diagnostic slpenectomy. Sound crazy to ask for an organ to be removed, but I am so exausted and depressed from not know why it is enlarged and hurting. I am fatigued all the time, My left side hurts all the time, if i drink alcohol my sleen hurts for 2 weeks, and all the doc's tell me is it is in my head as all my bloodwork is normal. Well this medical study shows that all patients showed normal bloodwork and mostly normal bmb's and 7 of the 18 people in the study had lymphoma with no enlarged nodes. I almost cried when i saw this study as I think mabie I can finally find out why I have suffered all this time. So I just wanted to post this for anyone else that may be having problems with idiopathic splenomegaly.

I have had many blood test from organ function to HIV, all have come back negative. I have had lymph node biopsy on right side, pathology report stated: reactive lymphoid follicular hyperplasia. Doctor put me on doxcylian for 6 weeks. I have been off antibiotics for two weeks now, lymph nodes have stayed the same in size and are still present. Anyone else been through this? Any suggestions to what to do next?

                Hello! Good day [or evening] to you all! 

Before I head to my concerns I'd like to mention a bit of my medical history and background (I hope it's helpful):

I'm nineteen, female and my lifestyle is fairly active. 

Last March, I was rushed to the hospital due to a very high fever. I was confined for four days and diagnosed with infectious mononucleosis (and I never heard the end of it from my mom HAHAHA). Ultrasounds done showed a swollen liver and an enlarged spleen. I apologize as I've lost the results of the bloodwork done back then. 

Symptoms completely disappeared and within two months (May), I was feeling fine. 

Early June, I noticed a weird lump on my neck. At first, I thought it was nothing-- probably the virus still trying to attack a bit. Then as the months passed, it hardened and grew more pronounced (slightly bigger). I went to my school clinic and they told me to have my ears cleaned. They said if the lump was still present after two weeks post-cleaning, have it checked. My mom mentioned the lump to my derma (September) and he said it was a lymph node and not to worry. 

A day after said consultation, another node popped up, this time a bit under my chin. I went to an ENT and he said not to worry-- during this time, I was having a bit of trouble breathing deeply. Two weeks passed and I developed pain in the right rib area. Concerned, my mother took me to a pulmonologist and he asked my why I didn't have the nodes checked sooner. 

He ordered some tests be done. Here's a summary and the test results:

Chest Xray (Oct. 9) - Clear 
Rib Cage Xray (Oct. 9) - Clear 
CBC (Oct. 1) - Values were all normal except my platelet count which was at 451. I assume this is unremarkable. 
ANA Blood Test (Oct. 9) - Negative
TB Blood Test (Oct. 9) - Negative **Quantiferon test**

Summary of my symptoms:
- Enlarged node on right side of neck (firm, rubbery, immovable); noticed 4 or 5 months ago
- Enlarged node under chin, near throat (firm, rubbery); noticed 2 or 3 few months
- A lump near the base of my neck, back side, inches away from my shoulder blades (rubbery); noticed yesterday HAHAHA 
- Both nodes and the lump are painless
- Occasional pain near right top rib (under breast) 
- Frequent mid-(or top not sure??)chest tightness and discomfort and pressure (feels like a track is being squished, more noticeable when stretching)
- Frequent dizziness 
- I easily run out of energy nowadays, it's quite frustrating

Hopefully useful information:
- I haven't had an ultrasound done to check the nodes 
- Strong family history of cancer (breast, stomach and lung) 
- I didn't have Primary Complex

I'd appreciate any ideas on what I can do and what's going on with my body. Any comments are appreciated. I'm only slightly concerned because the tiredness and dizziness are affecting day-to-day performance. Follow up with my pulmo is on Oct. 21! 

Also, I'm super sorry if any of you find this inappropriate to post on this specific section :(

                My 17 yr old daughter felt a lump on side of neck. Doctor measured it at 1.4cm and ordered an ultrasound. It is hard and rubbery and does not hurt. Ultrasound results state it has grown to 2.6cm x 1.3cm (in 1 month) and has no fatty hilum. Performed at a level 5 in the area of palpable abnormality. Mild increase in vascularity.
good
Has anyone else had a similar case and what was it?

Thank you, in advance, for any replies.

                I noticed a small lump side of my neck about 6 months ago when I had a really bad head cold.  I went to the doc 3 weeks later, she was not concerned at all, but said I can go for an ultrasound because I was really worried.  I went for an ultrasound, the report states ""benign appearing"".  There is the one I felt and 2 others apparently.  GP said no further action is required.  I pushed for an ENT referral, the ENT didn't even want to see me yet because the node is so small (1cmm x .5 x .1).  I insisted and finally got an appointment with the specialist.  He was not concerned at all and said just watch for other nodes and further symptoms.  I was not satisfied so I went to another GP, made her obtain the report and she said the exact same thing.  
When my first GP was checking the node, she pressed so very hard that the gland under my jaw (the one where when you have a sore throat swells), well that one got swollen.  It went down, but felt a bit of a cold a couple months ago and its still there.  I mentioned this to all the doctors, and they are not concerned.  I even went as far as to ask my dentist about these.  I don't know what else i should do.  The lump in the posterior triangle hasn't grown at all.  The one under the jaw 'seems' to have gone down, but maybe its wishful thinking.
Any insights?

                I had my port placed on we'd by a general surgeon and had my chemo Friday. My port is directly under the incision so the nurse had to stick the needle right through the incision site causing severe pain and for the glue to unhinge a bit. The pics and u-tube videos I see show the incision above or below the port! I will be angry if the surgeon messed up as he convinced me to let him do this procedure rather than the radiologists that usually do it. I just don't understand how the incision will ever be able to heal when it's stabbed every other week! And let me tell u I saw a lot of people saying port placement was practically painless and easy! I almost regret it because of how painful it still in at 1:54 am sat morn while I am unable to sleep due to the pain! And I am on Vicodin at that! Ugh sorry I am a bit frustrated and wonder if anyone else experienced this problem?

I had a CT without contrast done to look at a lung nodule that is staying stable in my RIGHT lung.  The nodule (4.5mm) has been stable for a couple of yrs now and considered benign.  I also have honeycombing in base of lungs and that has also been stable.

Now a new discovery.... **There are multiple enlarged lymph nodes in the LEFT axilla the largest measuring 12 mm in short axis which have increased since the prior exam. (1/8/14) ... Evaluation of hilar structures is limited due to lack of IV contrast.**  

Impression: 
1.  development of LEFT axillary lymphadenopathy.
2.  solitary nodule (right lung) is minor fissure has bee stable since 2013.  considered benign.  4 mm
3.  stable honeycombing within lung bases.  

I have rheumatoid arthritis, interstitial lung disease, sjogrens, raynauds, cryptogenic liver cirrhosis which has been stable and compensated, had gyn cancer stage 1 in 1998. 

I had a digital mammogram  this June, results were normal.  Though I do have dense breasts.   I get blood work done since I see the hepatologist every 6 months, my rheumatologist every 4 months.

I have been on biologics..and that worries me.   I am now just starting xeljanz (8/31).  I have been off of biologics since 12/2014 because of some of the warnings.  But the pain in my hands/fingers was so bad, I went back on a bio.  My inflammation was high during the 8 months off of a biologic.  

Can carrying heavy items cause enlarged lymph nodes?

My pulmonologist is sending the results to my PCP and I will see him this week.  

Just wondering what my PCP may do and any info you can give me.  

Thank you!

                So I've had swollen lymph nodes in my neck and head area for 6-8 months now and there not going away they shrink a lot then get back to bigger size or they get bigger then shrink back to normal size. I can also feel some in my groin but idk if that's normal they shrink and grow throughout the day and are biggest in the morning and smallest after working out or football practice when I first found lymph nodes I was very sick extreme fatigue headache Nassau. The doctor put me on 2 weeks of antibiotics and the symptoms went away but not the lymph nodes and they keep popping up once there here they don't really get any bigger except one that got big overnight and has stayed that size. I went to a health practitioner and she said it's probably a co infection to lymes disease and gave me some stuff witch made them get really small but are back to normal again idk what to do I'm really scared I'm making another appointment for the doctor. I'm 15 great health, 5'10, 140pounds, male

                Hey, I am a 21 year old male who is of normal weight and fairly decent health.  I recently decided to make some lifestyle changes and just started working out today.  I followed a plan that had me do as 3 sets of however many chin-ups I could do.  After the full workout I felt tired and sore, but that's normal.  I took a nap, and after I woke up I had some discomfort in my armpit, and that's when I felt the lump.  It sort of feels like its the muscle, because when I move my arm up and around the muscle feels tender. Its about the size of a golfball and is at the top end of my armpit.  I looked up a lot online and it seems like it could be a lymph node that is enlarged due to whatever reason, but I personally think it is a pulled muscle, since it randomly appeared after I worked out for the first time in a year or so.  It feels fairly firm too.  I can take a picture of it in the mirror if need be.

I've seen 3 hematologists and all of them said it's normal but I always insist on doing an ultrasound. last ultrasound was 2 weeks ago and here is the impression "" An enlarged lymph node 1.5cmx0.5cm is seen with echogenic hilum ( inflammatory lymph node)"" 

I'm still worried that it may be lymphoma. I don't have any symptoms but it's not normal for a lymph node to stay enlarged that long. I keep poking it and touch it all the time, can that be the reason why they haven't shrunk? 
and is ultrasound is reliable? I see some people say that they can tell if it looks suspicious and other people say that ultrasound is useless.. can anyone please help

                I am 30 female. I have seen a ENT regarding the swollen lymph node in my neck just below my jaw. I have had a biopsy revealing inflammation only on the swollen lymph nodes and two consecutive appointments a month apart where the lymph nodes are not growing larger. I have constant fatigue where I feel completely wiped out even after waking up some days and hot flashes that go from fine to immediately sweating in an air conditioned room. I have gone through at least 3 different antibiotics for any cause from infection. 

Recently I have painful and soreness under my arms towards my chest and increasing hot flashes. 

My ENT said that if it was ""bad"" that the lymph nodes would have gotten larger yet again and with the biopsy showing just inflammation not to worry about it. I am not really worried I am just tired of feeling like crap. Lost and not sure what to do and I just wanted to see if anyone had the same symptoms and if anyone received diagnosis after similar doctor visits. Thanks in advance!

                My wife had a swollen lymph node on the left of her cheek and we went to a specialist when she was in Germany. According to my wife the lymph node she felt from 3 years ago and has not changed in size. The lymph node seems hard. To our luck 2 weeks before we went to see the specialist she had high fever and the family doctor gave her antibiotics and she felt fine after that (also my 2 year old son got the same thing before my wife got it).

Few tests:

** They did blood work which came back normal with exception to little low red blood cell (iron deficiency)
** She did ct scan of neck and all we were told multiple swollen lymph nodes in neck but all less than 1 cm with the exception of the one from 3 years which is 1.3 cm.
** They did ESB/cat virus etc... tests and came back negative

The specialist advised her to see professor in bigger clinic and he said to his opinion he doesn't think it is cancer due to being there for 3 years without symptoms however he doesn't want to be held responsible if it turns out to be.

She will be back to US on sunday and I took an appointment here with a specialist to review the ct scan images and to check the node. How likely this is cancer giving the size etc....?

Next I began experiencing fevers every night for a month at around 100 degrees f. easy exhaustion, slight night sweats, and have unexplained weight loss of over 10 pounds in a month with no appetite. All the while I have a 6cm lump on my inner arm crease that has been making my arm painful and weak with swelling In my hand. Though the lump isn't painful to the touch. It is rubbery to the touch and the lymph nodes are hard fixed like this one and rubbery as well. I'm just wondering if this new large lump could be another swollen lymph node? Do I have reason for concern with these symptoms ? My doctor didn't seem concerned. I'm planning on seeking a second opinion.

They are pea size to a little big bigger. They are moveable and painless to the touch unless I move them around too much. Rubbery/softish. Occasionally I will feel a soreness to he area but not often.

I have no other symptoms to report with that. Where I live, getting in to see a doctor is a long wait. What are you opinions?

                My 7 year old daughter has been sick on and off for the last 3.5 years.  It's almost identical symptoms every time except it is gradually getting worse. She starts with high fever that averages about 104.5 for about 24-48 hours, then she gets better for a day or two.  The severe headache sets in after that lasting for 24-48 hours.  She's in pain to the point where she doesn't leave bed and cries for someone to take her to the bathroom when she needs to go.   Sometimes all of this will be accompanied by swollen lymph nodes different places on her body.  Every time I have taken her to the ER they give her antibiotics and send us on our way. One time they did  blood work and found high white blood cells, said she probably had an infection somewhere they just didn't know where.   She will be good for a few weeks to a month and then it starts all over again.  The most recent trip to the ER resulted in them doing a urine sample and finding white blood cells in her urine.  When they sent it away for cultures it came back with no bacteria.  The most recent thing that has started happening is she gets little red marks on her face that almost look like broken blood vessels.  She has seen a paediatrician recently who is sending her for head MRI, ultrasound on kidneys and a long list of blood work.  She also is very thin and has a hard time gaining weight. I'm starting to really worry and was wondering if anyone else has ever dealt with this?!?

                I had IDC 6 years ago with a lumpectomy, chemo and radiation.  I have had normal mammograms and ultra sounds since then.  I have had a saroma in the breast since surgery.  I went last week for my routine mammogram and the radiologist said while he was looking at the ultra sound screen that he was seeing what looked like a pocket of fluid and it was not there on my previous exam.  I am scheduled for an aspiration with possible biopsy next week.  My fear is that it will not aspirate and will end up being a cancerous tumor.  I have been taking Arimidex for 6 years and just 2 weeks ago my tumor marker and CBC blood work came back normal.  It seems to me that the fact that I am on Arimidex and the labs were normal, that it would be in my favor that it will prove to be nothing.  Should I be concerned?  It's really making me anxious.

                Hi, my father is 77. He is diabetic. He had chest and abdominal ct scan in august, that showed some lymph nodes slightly enlarged (11 mm). Last week his doctor sent him for another CT, which showed chest and abdominal lymph nodes enlarged to 2 cm. Any ideas? Can it be from rescent infection in his foot? Or is it cancer?
I am really worried....

                You seem to know a great deal on blood disorders ----are you a doctor or a well read son??

What is Mantel Cell Lymphoma?

My precious mother died in 2006 from  MDS that escalated into CML --This was a secondary condition from a chemo drug she had been taking for Platelets counts in the thousands. I know I read everything I could get my hands on at the time--not much could be done but I did request some experimental drugs--she lived three years with the last 6 months of weekly infusons of blood and platelets.. It is agony for the ones that love them to watch so helplessly.

I have never heard of Mantel cell Lymphoma---but then my research was not on Lymphoma.

Sincerely,
CML

                Ok so I'm 15 about 2-3 months ago I noticed a swollen lymph node in my neck that was small and wasn't to worried after about 2 weeks it didn't go away or change I went to the doctor and she told me not to worry later I about a week later I found another small one in my neck. I told my mom she said don't worry to much but I did anyway about a week after that I noticed another and went to the doctor had blood drawn and everything was clear white blood cells was fine and all the other test. Later that weak I had something wrong and a lot of symptoms. I had Fatique headache stomach issues and depression. About a week later I went to the doctor for a physical and she gave me 14 days of antibiotics. The first day the lymph nodes seemed to decrease. After 1-3 days I felt better and finished my antibiotics and I feel fine but all the lymph nodes where still there. I get a little fuzziness in my head but my mom says it's my allergies and it goes away after a little and allergy medicine. So my mom said don't worry about it but about a week or 2 later I noticed one behind my ear very small like the rest. I haven't gone to the doctor because my mom says it's probably hormones or stress. But you know I'm the person who looks stuff up and think of the worse I've been very stressed and scared about it. My family doesn't have a long line of cancer my mom had thyroid cancer and that's it. I'm very healthy eat lots of healthy foods none of my parents smoke neither do I I play lots of sports very active. I'm not sexually active either. I'm 135 pounds 5'9 male Age 15. Btw I do touch my lymph nodes and mess with them a little I used to a lot but I read it's bad to do that. And there all under the size of 2cm. Any advice or anything would help. Btw I had a chest xray and everything was clear. Idk I just think have cancer.

                Hi.  A month ago I went in for an ultrasound in my right neck after suspected lymph node enlargement.  They ended up finding a couple of enlarged lymph nodes that were up to 1.3cm in diameter.  The letter said the doctor described them to be reactive.  I have a couple of questions...

1. Can an ultrasound actually distinguish reactive from malignant lymph nodes?

2. I was referred to an ENT specialist, but was told it is just if I wanted to be extra sure.  Doesn't seem like the PCP thinks it is anything to worry about.  Do you think I need to worry too much about the referral?

3. I also have been having this intermittent minor pain in my left rear lat muscle.  Could that be a lymph node too?

4. My right shoulder muscles are very sore.  I think it was due to injury from weightlifting but could this pain also be due to an enlarged lymph node?

Thanks for any help you might be able to offer.  My ENT appointment isn't for another two weeks and I must admit I have a lot of anxiety about it, especially after learning my mother mught have cancer.

                I have had an elevated white blood cell count for about 4 months. During this time I have had intermittent left arm pain, jaw pain, chest pain, and upper back pain that basically mimics a heart attack and have had severe anxiety and feeling weak with exertion for about the same amount of time. I had my gallbladder removed 3 weeks ago because I was having right upper quadrant pain and digestive issues and had a hida scan that showed my gallbladder only having a 16% ejection fraction. I was hoping having it removed would make all of my symptoms go away but the only thing it helped was the RUQ pain and digestive issues. The cardiac like pain and anxiety plus weakness on exertion and the elevated white blood cell count has unfortunately continued. As far as other symptoms go I have also had headaches that seem to be in the sinus area, my muscles get shaky when I am trying to pick things up or use them at a moderate level, PVC's with my heart, within the past year and a half I have lost about 70 lbs but I have to take pain medication due to a bad back that makes me not have an appetite so I don't eat a lot or normal and when I make myself eat normal I will gain weight. I weighed 308 lbs and am now 240 lbs. I seem to tire fairly easily since the main symptoms started about 4 months ago and that's when the weakness comes on and its intermittent. I haven't noticed any rashes or bruising easily or aches and pains anymore than what I normally did years ago before all of this. As far as medical tests go I have had 6 EKG's, wore a 24 hour heart halter monitor, 2 chest X Rays, probably 6 different blood tests with CBC over the past 4 months, 1 arterial blood gas test, neck X Ray and neck MRI, a gallbladder ultrasound, gallbladder hida scan, and a blood test to check my thyroid and to test for H Pylori with metabolic panel checking for possible reasons for the fatigue. The only things that have shown up abnormal is of course the gallbladder hida scan which resulted in getting my gallbladder removed 3 weeks ago, the CBC W/ auto diff blood tests that have shown my white blood cell count to be high every time ranging from 12.3 to 19.0 with the reference range being 4.8-10.8, and my neck MRI showed a 2mm left paracentral disc protrusion at C5-C6 with no herniation no other findings. My red blood cell count has always been good and up until my last blood test my platelet count has been good but it was 78 with the reference range being 130-400 on my last blood test a few days ago but I had just finished a round of amoxicillin for a possible sinus infection about 3 days before having the blood test so I'm not sure if that could have affected it or not. With my white blood cell count being broken down on one of my blood tests it is as follows- white blood cell count 19 with the reference range being 4.8-10.8, %Neutro 71.8 reference range 42.0-75.0, %Lymph 20.1 reference range 20.5-51.1, %Mono 6.8 reference range 5.0-11.0, %EOS 0.8 reference range 1.0-3.0, %Baso 0.5 reference range 0.0-1.0, #Neutro 13.6 reference range 1.4-6.5, #Lymph 3.8 reference range 1.2-3.4, #Mono 1.3 reference range 0.1-0.6, #Eos 0.2 reference range 0.0-0.2, #Baso 0.1 reference range 0.0-0.1. I have seen probably 4 different ER doctors as well as my family doctor and a cardiologist and none of them have mentioned anything about testing for any types of cancer including leukemia throughout this past 4 months and have only been saying I need to keep taking blood tests to monitor my white blood cell count because I most likely have an infection or some type of inflammation somewhere in my body or possibly my stress level/anxiety could be causing the white blood cell count to be high. What do you all think?

                Hi
For the last two months, I've been experiencing unusual neck pain under my chin - around the salivary gland area which comes and goes and seems to flare up and feel inflamed. 

I've also had along with this a foul taste/smell from the back of my throat/mouth on and off, also I have Hypothyroid/Hashimotos and my Thyroid feels like it is burning sometimes when all the other stuff flares up and it is very sore and uncomfortable. I feel exhausted a lot and the neck pain is very worrying. My GP has ruled out Lymphoma and anything serious, I've had x2 Ultrasound scans and 1x CT scan, Waiting currently for an MRI scan to rule anything else out. I was told initially it could be salivary gland stones - but nothing has been found or diagnosed yet I continue to be in pain and also another horrible symptom, is that when this all flares up, I feel like I am coming down with the Flu yet I have no Flu symptoms other than the sore neck and feel like I am burning up time to time.
Any suggestions what this could be? I am waiting to see an ENT specialist on the ever so long NHS waiting lists in UK and have been made to feel that if I go back to my GP about this anymore they are starting to think I am a hypochondriac.
My CBC and WBC are within range I've been told and my Thyroid levels are within the normal range with my medication. So, I am completely baffled what is causing all of this?
Any help appreciated!

                It's been over a year since I have noticed swollen lymph nodes in my neck (posterior and submandibular chain). At the beginning I thought they are just ""shotty"" lymph nodes which remained palpable after having infectious mononucleosis in 2011. However, they seemed to be over 1cm so I decided to make an appointment with my GP.

I have been told that swollen lymph nodes are not a rare phenomenon and there is no reason why I should be worried about them. My GP ordered various blood tests (e.g. CBC with differential, kidney function, liver function, ESR, LDH), all of which came back clear. I also had a chest X-ray which was fine.

I saw a haematologist today and was told that as long as my blood tests such as LDH are fine, there is no reason to be concerned about lymphadenopathy. Hence, I was discharged and been told to come back in 3 months time.

Do you think I should insist on having an ultrasound or FNAB done?

P.S I don't have any chronic conditions apart from TMD and scoliosis which was corrected with spinal fusion.

Thanks in advance for those taking time to respond!

Cheers,

                Alright I am 19 and for the past 20 months have been dealing with a hodge podge of seemingly endless symptoms. It started with an extreme infection in my hand that cause the tip of my thumb to turn all sorts of nastly colors and discolored my hand and pain until the tip of the skin of my thumb sluffed like giant scab. After that I have been dealing with severe fatigue, my bones ache, constant infections, and getting sick all the time. I have been bounced from specialist to specialist as one will tell me its not this your symptoms seem more like this field, so on and so forth. Until finally for the past 8 months I got in with an Internal Medicine doctor. Mainly he has been focusing on putting all the opinions together and managing my symptoms as most of imaging and blood tests come back normal even when symptoms like swelling are visible.  I am goal oriented and haven’t let this stop my life putting time into my studies to maintain my 4.0. But I knew how I feel isn’t normal. My doc diagnosed me with chronic fatigue syndrome and  due to my fatigue symptoms but now is revisiting the diagnosis because of the bone aches and of new symptoms  to now include.
Recurrent Infections : scalp, underarms, eye, sinuses, ear (take antibiotics every day still have symptoms)
Severe Fatigue
Breathlessness : normal chest xray
Bone pain
Chills
Swollen lymph nodes on neck
Bruising
Now my doc at my last visit mentioned hematology at my last appointment as well as immunology. My question is with a normal CBC and US of my nodes should I just go with immunology? Or is leukemia/lymphomas still a possibility?

                Roughly two years ago a large bump grew seemingly out of nowhere on the back right side of my neck. It was probably the size of a nickel and very noticeable. I joked about growing a 3rd eye. It didn't necessarily hurt, but it was irritated. After a couple weeks the swelling started to go down and was no longer visible. If I feel around I can still feel the bump. Much smaller, I would guess a centimeter or so. It doesn't hurt and it is not visible. 

My doctor didn't notice it until I pointed it out. 

He told me the good news was that cancerous lumps tend to not just shrink. He also said it's a good sign that it has not increased in size since it shrank. However, he said the fact that it is painless and been there so long is concerning. He has referred me to an ENT for a second opinion. 

I'm so concerned about it being cancerous. He did not think it was a cyst, because he said swelling would typically take longer than a couple weeks to go down. He did think it was a lymph node but he said it was questionable/not certain. 

Is there any reason a lymph node could stay swollen this long that is not cancer? 

Can you share insight about my story, the placement, etc.? 

Anything would be helpful.

                I am a 20 year old female in good health. I had noticed throughout the pain that I had been feeling some sore-like pain in my groin area. While showering, I felt it and felt a small pea/peanut-sized lump near where I would assume my lymph nodes are located on the left side. It was very painful to touch. I am alarmed because my cousin (mothers sister's daughter) was diagnosed with breast cancer 5 years ago, my mom was diagnosed with triple negative breast cancer 3 years ago, my dad was just diagnosed with Non-Hodgkin lymphoma in April after undergoing open abdominal aneurysm repair, and my aunt was just diagnosed with stage 3/4 Ovarian cancer (my mother's sister) with metastises (spelling.. Sorry) throughout her abdomen. My mother's dad died of Prostate cancer.  Naturally,  I'm horrified and extremely paranoid. I was recently on a lake and have a case of what I think might be swimmers itch, but I'm not sure. Is it possible the lymph node is swollen because of that? I can't help but feel I need to have it checked... Just not sure my family can take anymore news. Thoughts?

                Ok so I've had a swollen (what ENT are calling) a lymph node under the right side of my chin for about a year, I kept going to the doctor and they kept saying the same calico died lymph node.
Anyway this last week it seemed to get bigger and then another one popped up underneath it which ached at first then just became painless like the other one, no other lymph nodes are up in my neck but my neck aches all the time and under my armipits.
I've been waking up in the night clammy too and have a hoarse voice on and off, the ENT said that my throat looked fine when they put a camera down but decided to send me for an emergency ultrasound scan anyway with a possible biopsy 
While this is going On, I've had really bad diarrhoea for three weeks now - but only in the morning, I was off my food for about three days but I seem to be able to manage stuff now but I don't feel like I want it. 
I've been seen in the hospital several times - all blood work as come back perfect and a clear chest X-ray , I had as an on my stomach in March which said all was clear with spleen etc 
But I suffer with anxiety anyway and now I'm having panic attacks due to this, I've had to stop breast feeding my baby so I can be medicated for the attacks and the doctors can't do me a scan for the next two weeks!! How am I supposed to cope until then plus it says that diarrhoea is an advanced sign of lymphoma so I'm so scared, I've got 4 kids and a lazy *** husband I love him to bits but can't stand the thought of having to leave him to bring up my kids on his own!

                Hi, 

So I found three lumps at the upper left side of my neck. Two months later and several doc visits later, I was sent to the surgeon to remove the biggest one, which was like 3,5*1,5 cm big, almond shaped, soft, movable, non tender but...big. I had a weird neck infection before this but they didn't find anything suspicious. My chest X-ray is ok, ultrasound of my abdomen too (or at least it was, 3 weeks ago) and my bloodwork is also completely normal... I'm scared that the biopsy will show something bad and need stories about benign big lymph nodes and support from you folks since I've read some posts here and you are just an amazing group in this. 
Also, I've noticed a golf ball sized lump/knot right under my incision... Have any of you experienced something like this? It's a bit tender, round, soft movable. Almost like a lymph node but the one there was taken out and it's really a perfect circle...

It has been a week since my biopsy and they told me to call for the results today but they are not back yet and I have to wait for another week! It's devastating! So anxious... 

Thanks for any reply.

I wasn't satisfied with the answer I got because I knew I wasn't stressed and I had a feeling that something wasn't right, I showed a family member the lumps on my neck and they pushed me to go back to the doctor this time he looked concerned and sent my blood to be tested a few days later I went back to me Gp and he confirmed that it was glandular fever. That was almost 3 weeks ago and I'm feeling a lot better but still a little tired. However I am growing concerned about the lumps on my neck which haven't changed in size at all.

                My 12yr old son had some blood work done in the ER, we were there due to some severe abdominal pain. They found nothing on the Cat-scan and could not explain the pain. After about six hours and vomiting once the pain in stomach did get better. 
The ER Dr. told me that she was concerned about his labs and printed it off for me. 
these are the things that are flagged

WBC 16.2 (H)
Segmented Neutrophils 92.1 (H)
Lymphocyte 3.7 (L)
Lymphocyte Absolute 0.6 (L)
Absolute Neutrophil 14.9 (H)

He has always been a super healthy kid. He seems to be feeling better however his appetite has decreased and he is very pale and seems to not be quite as energetic as normal. We just moved to a new town so I am in the process of finding a new Dr for him to see, so it may be a day or so before I can get him in for an appointment. Any advice that anyone could give me would be great. I am not sure how concerned I should be because I don't know what these labs mean.

Thank you so much

                Hi Everyone, I am very worried and am looking for some advice. 4 weeks ago I discovered a small cervical posterior lymph node on the right side of my neck. It is small and moveable. It has not grown. I have not had any dental or scalp infections that I know of (have dry scalp though) and I have taken antibiotics (augmmentin) for 3 days and had to stop due to having a very bad gastro-intestinal virus. I suffer from sinuses. I do not have fever, night sweats or weight loss. I have Hashimotos Hypothyroidism, my tsh levels have finally stabilised (taking euthyrox daily) but ofcourse my antibodies are in the thousands. I am freaking out about this lymph node, its only one, I cannot feel any palpable nodes in the armpit area or groin. just this one small (1cm) lymph node in my neck, it gets a bit tender if I poke it around. but otherwise I have no flu or cold or any symptoms that can indicate that its from an infection. I did bloodtests and they came back normal, except for low neutrophils, everything else like lymphocytes and ehamaglobin etc was perfectly normal. I am scheduled for a sonar next week Friday. Im also considering doing the tumour markers bloodtest. I am very very worried that it may be lymphoma. Any advice will be greatly appreciated

                About 6 months ago I discovered 2/3 lumps behind my ear. At first, like many others I thought nothing of them and expected them to disappear. However after a couple of months they were still there. I have consulted my parents a couple of times on this matter however they have just brushed it aside. I have not experienced any side effects that I know of and they do not cause me any pain at all. Neither have the lumps enlarged in size since I first discovered them. I have searched many sites to try and find out what the lumps could be. And I still don't know exactly what they are. My questions are. What are they?,what should I do about them?,are they serious or harmless? And should I be worried or concern d about them?. A reply to my questions would be very helpful as I am becoming more and more worried about the lumps everyday.

                Hello everyone. I went to my doctor about a month ago for stress (daily vomiting, sometimes multiple times, unintentional weight loss [10% of my body weight], and general uneasy feelings). She sent me for an abdominal ultrasound (normal) and bloodwork. My blood work came back with the following results and she's sending me for more. 

24 year old, female, with children
Platelets appear adequate. Red cells appear normal. 
Neutrophils: 6.46 (ref range:1.8-7.0)
Lymphocytes: 1.62 (ref range:1.0-3.2)
Monocytes: 0.81 (ref range:0.0-0.8)
Eosinophils: 1.21 (ref range:0.0-0.4)
Basophils: 0.00 (ref range:0.0-0.2)
All are units x 10*9/L

I am still vomiting, still feel unwell, still losing weight, and have now added sunken eyes and easily bruising to my list. A nurse friend suggested I make another appointment to discuss leukaemia, and I have, but it's 3 weeks from now. I was wondering if anyone had any input here. Thank you!

                I heard recently on a tv show that there are blood tests that will confirm whether you are likely to get leukemia.  Both my parents died of leukemia in 2009.  My father had AML, my mother had CML.  Can anyone give me some information I am seeking?

I was asked to have a blood test taken in 2009, and my doctor then said there was something they would watch, but then she retired, and I have no idea what she was talking about.

Any info would be a benefit!  Thank you!

                Hi! I am a 26 years old woman.
Got some blood work done in October, the results were fairly average, but my lymphocytes were at the low end (1.5) and my RBC were also low.
This winter I was almost constantly sick, and I felt very fatigued.

Today I went and had another set of blood work done, and my lymphocytes got even lower (1,1) and my RBC is still low (4.3). Eosinophiles are also low (0.1), but Monocytes are normal.
MCH is at the high end of the spectrum (31.2) and RDW at the low end (11.8), but still nothing to worry about.

However, this coupled with the joint and bone pain I felt throughout this spring got me pretty worried.
Can this results show a malignancy? Thank you in advance.

                I am an 18 year old female. About two months ago I located a lump in my left thigh that was on the muscle and moveable. It feels hard, yet rubbery. When I press on it, it feels like a bruise of a knot. I am very concerned about it. You cannot see it if my legs are straight, but when my leg is bent it I can feel and see it. It is smooth feeling and the lump is rounded. I have trouble sitting with my legs crossed as it tugs on my knee. As for seeing a doctor I was sent for an ultrasound which came back inconclusive and I am being sent for an MRI which will most likely result in a biopsy. My doctor said muscle cancer is VERY rare and that she can my guarantee anything. If anyone could give some sort of advice or input I would appreciate it greatly. I cannot stop crying.

                Good Morning,

This is my story.  April the 21, 2014 I noticed an ingrown on the left side of my jaw line.  This was not a surprise for me because I have very thick facial hair and I've had ingrown before.  After aggressively squeezing and poking at it for a week it became the size of a quarter.  Very hard and I can see pus build of deep inside the skin.  It looked like a huge red not on my face.  At the same time I got 2 canker sores in my mouth.  April 29th in the shower i notices a bump on the left side of my neck.  After playing around with it for a few days i finally realized it was a swollen lymph node.  I can actually squeeze the skin together and feel the tine ball underneath my skin.  Went to my dr may 1st and she said it felt like a swollen lymph node.  She said she was not surprise it was swollen because of the massive ingrown and the 2 canker sores in my mouth.  She sent me to a dermatologist.  Well, I'm concerned about the swollen lymph node because its not tender(painless) and its easily movable.  Anyways, the dermatologist confirmed it was a swollen lymph node and said its possible the ingrown is cause a reaction with the lymph node.  He gave me a topical antibiotic for the ingrown which is helping the ingrown, but the lymph node is still swollen and i can totally see it popping out when i turn my head in a certain direction.  Aanyway, the dermatologist told me not to worry and to come back in 2 months and if its still there he will send me to an ENT and get a biopsy.  That really scared the **** out me.  To make a long story short my wife works for a very well known family and was able to get me an appointment at the university of Chicago hospital with the director of the ENT  dept.  Im totally freaking out here.  I have 2 young boys at home and our third child is due june 18.  My questions:  painless movable swollen lymph nodes common with at infected ingrown?  Shouldnt they be tender?  Can the canker sores and infected ingrown cause a swollen lymph node on the side of my neck?  Please someone help and an advice will be appreciated greatly.

                I'm a 15 year old, 5'9 female, weighing 120 pounds. For months now I have been experiencing extreme fatigue, especially recently. It is super hard to stay awake during school and even harder to wake up on the morning- let alone actually get out of bed! Off and on I've been getting random ""infections"", or whatever they may be. Two months ago I was in the hospital with a crippling headache, fever, and rash- turns out I had strep throat (even though I had my tonsils taken out when I was 7). Because pills wouldn't work, they gave me meds through an IV. Before that, earlier in the school year, I had stayed home on multiple occasions either because of being ill or the lack of ability to get through the day. So far this year I have missed nearly 11 days of school because of this stuff. Here recently, things haven't gotten any better- more like worse. Every morning I wake up drenched in sweat which accumulates overnight. Even when I remove covers, the problem isn't solved because I just wake up again by coldness! Along with this, morning's ALWAYS bring nausea and dizziness- total weakness. A few weeks ago, I began to develop what looked/looks like some sort of rash? It consists of red bumps, although they aren't raised, that itched at first. Now, the itching has completely subsided, and the red spots look and feel like bruises! Soon after, and over all feeling of aching took over. Following this, a lymph node on the left side of my neck became swollen, and still is. It is tender to the touch, but not exactly ""painful"". Because of this, my dad decided to take me to see a nurse practitioner at a nearby pharmacy. Vitals were taken, and I was surprised by my weight decrease- three weeks earlier I was 128, now 120lbs! I knew that I had a loss of appetite, but I was still eating what I thought was a normal amount? Anywho, the nurse took my temperature and I had a 101degree ""fever"", if you'd like to call it that. I had NO idea that I was running one! The practicioner eventually gave me a strep-test, which came back negative. The lady was baffled, because she had convinced herself that that was the case. Because she had no idea of what was causing my symptoms, I was given Amoxicillin to fight off any infection that I may have. When I got home, I took my temperature (three/four hours later) and it was 96 degrees- I was of course, very confused by this. The persistent headache that I had been having continued, getting worse and worse, especially on the back of my head. To top everything off, my lower back gave me nearly debilitating pain, as well had my legs (hips, knees, etc). Random bruises started appearing, which was happening, but not to this extent. And every time after I ate a meal, I would get a sharp, but aching pain right below my ribs. 9 days after my most recent doctor's visit, I was taken to my actual pediatrician, because I was told that if my symptoms did not improve, to visit a doctor. Well, when I got there, my temperature was back up to 101.5 degrees (what?). I told the doctor everything that had been going on, and he simply stated that it was allergies or the reminents of a virus. Number one, I don't have allergies, number two, how could this be a virus!? I was told by my therapist and the nurse practitioner that blood would likely be drawn to look for infections or other possibilities. Well, this didn't happen. The doctor barely looked over me either? I was simply told to ""come back if it gets worse"". I'm slightly pissed off, because my parents are dismissing my symptoms and how bad I feel because it will ""more than likely go away"". If it was going to go away, wouldn't it be gone already? This stuff started months ago?

I am in need of some serious help here- all of these symptoms are still occurring, and I just want to know what is going on. I don't know what is wrong with me!
Am I going crazy, or is this stuff actually happening or even related in any way?!
If you read this crazy long thing- THANK YOU!
I have no one to go to and talk about this with, so any comments or replies are appreciated...

                Im 30, male, healthy until all of a sudden six weeks ago i got severly sick. Symptoms included fever, mildly swollen but painful lymph nodes, night sweats and oral sores. These symptoms lasted three weeks. Then I became fatigued and started getting blood blisters and purpura inside my mouth on the insides of my cheeks. I also had heart palpitations and burning lungs  

The most constant symptom has been a swollen tongue with a burning numb sensation at the tip and hypertrophied fungiform papillae (little red dots) on the tip of my tongue. My night sweats are gone now and the lymph nodes are still occasionally tender but not nearly as bad as during week 1  

But my tongue is still swollen and dotted red. If you click on my name and go to my profile you'll see photos of my tongue and blood test results. Does anyone think I may have lymphoma? I've been tested for HIV mono and hepatitis all results negative. Please let me know if lymphoma b symptoms come and go like this. I'd really appreciate any opinions or insights any of you have. Also are there are tests I should have run for lymphoma?  Many thanks

Dr then ordered labs (just this week) which showed an exceptionally high ABS Monocyte 1.55 (normal range is .25-.71) slightly low lymphocyte % 41.9 (range is 42-78) Monocyte % was high, 21.5 (range 0-9) and B/C ration of 43.3 (range .6-1.3) An ultrasound was done today and the radiologist reported no abnormal tissue in cyst. The dr is out and I'm just curious what such a high monocyte could mean. She is not sickly, very active and generally good humor.

I was admitted and had a bone marrow transplant in August, since then my WBC,s  have gone as high as 7.1 but drop they are currently 5.1 my RBC,s average 3.8 and my platelets average 101. My 100 day biopsy was positive and I have test positive in February for BCR/ABL quantative level. I do have a 3 way mutation involving 9.22.11
My hematologist is worried about using another T.K.I. with the reaction I had with the disantib. I am currently on heavy antiviral's including 10mg a day of tacralinus. I also have G.V.H.D. My WBC,s dropped 1.1 point over a 30 day period my RBC,s and platelets are also trending down. any thoughts would be helpful.
I understand it is unusual for a C.M.L. patient to have a transplant with the new T.K.I.s available but I think maybe the 3 gene may be causing the problem

I have been getting these tiny red spots called petechiae, but they have been around for like 5 months so I don't know if I should be  concerned for those. After research they aren't widespread like most of the pictures ive seen. they are confined to a small area at different parts of my body over this time period at different times like my side rib cage lower stomach and my inner thighs,they eventually go away. I also have not had them in almost 4 weeks

 I also have pain in my upper elbow that's starting to get a little worse, that has been around for like 3 months .My right leg is smaller than the other and I get slight thigh discomfort. 

 I can still heavily exercise with these things not getting in my way but ever since my grandma was diagnosed with leukemia AT JUST 59( the average age of cancer diagnosis is 66) I have been real conscious of my health. Althoguh it was a 2 years ago I still cant stop thinking about it. She was diagnosed with AML.


 I haven't had a fever 
 I haven't had any night sweats 
 I haven't had any swollen lymph nodes 
 I haven't had any loss of appetite 
 I haven't had any weight loss either

                I went to the doctor in 
February due a swollen lymph node in my neck. I told her that I had first noticed it in January and that it has neither increased or decreased in size from what I could tell. She didn't seem TOO concerned about it, but ordered an ultrasound for me anyways. I went to get an ultrasound the next day and these were the results: 

Ovoid left submandibular lymph node (level IB) noted, measuring 10 x 5 x 9 mm (transverse, AP and CC dimension respectively). Internal architecture is heterogeneous with lack of normal hilar morphology. Intralesional hypervascularity noted with a 
centralized feeding vessel. Adjacent smaller hypoechoic lymph node noted measuring 7 x 5 x 5 mm. This also demonstrates lack of normal hilar morphology. Visualized regional musculature demonstrates a normal sonographic appearance. 

IMPRESSION: 
Ovoid hypervascular node at the left submandibular region, suspect inflammatory (reactive) lymph node. However given abnormal architecture and hypervascularity, malignant node or other neoplasm remain considerations. Consider followup ultrasound in 2-3 
months for revaluation. 


So basically, my next appointment is coming up and I'm getting more and more anxious about it. 

Like I said, the lymph node I can feel is hard but very movable. The other one they found, I can't feel no matter how much I press on my neck. 

Anyone have any opinions?

: Also, I get sinus infections all the time, so I'm hoping that it is nothing more than a couple shotty nodes. But the larger one almost seems a little too big to be that. 

I also have been getting those tonsil stones a lot, lately. Could that mean anything?

 And I have bad chin acne, but even on the rare occasion that clears up, my lymph node swelling does not go down.

Also, I wasn't sure which community to post this under since I haven't been officially diagnosed with anything.

                Many weird things on.

To start:
Odd sensation on left side of face started MONTHS ago. It only happens when I wash my face. Shooting electric like type sensation is best way I can describe it. I blew it off. @ routine obgyn visit, I asked doc about it. She brought up Trigiminal neuralgia and made me promise to check into so I made appointment with GP.

In the interim, I had a routine eye exam. During dilation, it was discovered I have an enlarged optic nerve in my left eye. Eye doc sends me to opthomologist neurologist. 

At that appointment, He saw the swelling, but said it was simply a benign condition and called it pseudopapilledema. That same afternoon I had appointment with general practitioner. She's concerned because they're both on the same side of face and to add to my fear, while examining my eyes, she noticed my eyes weren't working together when she had me follow her scope to my nose. so, she calls the doc I saw that morning and he said nothing to worry about because it was this Pseudothing and that my eyes probably weren't working properly from that mornings dilation. GP, doesn't by it and is sending me to get an MRI. 

Another weird thing is that I have DRENCHING night sweats. I soak the bed, pillow, covers to the point we have to change sheets and I have to change clothes. I've been blowing that off cause I'm 42 and thought I was going thru ""the change"" but doc says no, I'm too young for that and even if it were premenaposal night sweats, it wouldn't be drenching.

Can all this be related? Or just odd coincidences? GP ordered full blood work up too. Asked about family history of autoimmune diseases, leukemian, and lymphoma.

I'm a little freaked out. None of these things seem like anything ""major"" right? GP is suspicious so I'm getting worried.

Any advice or insight is greatly appreciated!

                On Friday, April 10th, I had a sore throat. I didn't think anything of it because I just thought it was from giving oral to my boyfriend the night before. But on Saturday my mom had a look at my throat and my tonsils were swollen and had a couple white spots, one on my right and on my left. Didn't think anything of it again and just gargled with warm salt water. Then I noticed my right lymph node, right under my jaw, was very enlarged. But I still didn't think anything of it because it's happened once before, the day after giving oral. But now I'm starting to worry because a couple nights ago I looked in the mirror and my right tonsil was exceptionally larger than my left, it took up about half the back of my throat. I was able to breathe fine. I do not have swollen lymph nodes under my left jaw or anywhere else in my body. It's also very firm and doesn't feel like I can move it. I'm very afraid it's lymphoma because I am only 18. I have a very distant relative on my mother's side who just went into remission from lymphoma, could it have skipped down to me? I also noticed a small red rash next to my lips. Please, if anyone has any advice let me know. I'm just really really scared to go to the doctor's and my mom finding out I was sexually active

                     I am 15 years old boy. June of last year, I found a lump in my groin. The lump is about 1.5cm ✖️0.6-7cm in size. It is firm but not very hard. First, I thought it was a Lipoma but after I searched on internet, I learned that there is an inguinal lymph node on groin part. I also learned that swollen node might be a symptom of lymphoma or leukimea. So I was very scared but forgot to go see the doctor at that time. 
     Yesterday, I just remembered about the lump and tried to touch it. The lump was still there with no major change in size and shape. It is about 1.5cm on long axis and 0.6-7cm on short axis. This time I went to see the doctor and he told me not to worry. According him, my lump is too small to suspect the cancer and swollen lymph nodes that might be the symptom of lymphoma/Leukimea usually have irregular or circular shape.(mine is oval like a bean). He also said that if I had a cancer, the lump should be grown larger and other symptoms should appear because it's been almost 10months since I first found the lump. So I asked him if it might be an indolent type of lymphoma. Then he said that indolent lymphoma like follicular lymphomas are rare in children and adolecent even though they are common in adults and pediatric follicular lymphoma has high proliferation rate(which means the disease will spread quickly). Therefore, my lump is most likely just a regular inguinal lymph node (Size varies from 0.5cm-2cm according to him) according to him. He told me to come back if the lump gets larger than 2cm on long axis or 1cm on short axis.
However I am very afraid that it might be to late if I wait because I already left the lump for 10months. So do you think I should go see the doctor again? Or should I follow his word and wait till it gets bigger.

 last month he threw up and had diarrhea but was better by afternoon and slept it off.
 He has been on minocycline for acne for about 6 months now. We took him to a out clinic because they have labs there and they came by high white blood count in urine but the culture was negative but still the dr said he likely had a  UTI bacterial infection and put him on Bactrim for 10 days. he did a TSH THYROID  test and it was high at 6 but dr said to retest in a month. WHAT DO YOU THINK>? 
Seven days and he is still fatigue and sleeps a lot. His grades are the same. He does seem to be irritable, little appetite, but he is a picky eater and he stays indoors a lot. He does take a b complex and multi vitamin most days  and he skips lunch every day at school. HELP.....DESPERATE MOM...

                My story...

I noticed a swollen node under my left ear right on the corner of the angel of the jaw 5 months ago.  It is hard, fixed, and not tender.  I'm not sure how large it is because it goes down deep (about 1 cm wide).  I have not had any drenching night sweats; however, there have been a number of nights in the last 5 months that I wake up freezing and realize that my hair and clothes are damp (I assume I was sweating).  I have lost 30 lbs in the last 3 months (about 11% of my body weight) without trying.  Most (not all) mornings my legs will start to itch, the itching gets worse and then sometimes hives will come with it (sometimes).  Needless to say I'm freaking out.  I'm a 32 year old mother to a 3 and 1 year old with no history of lymphoma in my family; other cancers but no lymphoma.  My GP didn't seem concerned because ""I look so healthy.""  I'm not sure what blood tests she did; however they came back ""good.""  I also had a chest xray which came up ""clear.""  I'm on my 5 day of a 7 day antibiotic treatment and the lymph node is still swollen.  I have an ENT appointment this Friday and was wondering what to expect.  I am afraid of my concerns not being taken seriously.  Will the ENT decided whether or not to do a biopsy?  Will I have to wait another month to do that? 

Thanks for all your help

That was a symptom for me the first time being that the tumor encased my subclavian artery and was hitting nerves and restricted blood supply. I made an appointment with my oncologist before the appointment date I started a new symptom. I now have a lump feeling in my throat and its hard to swallow. This too was a symptom the first time. This feeling is only cm from my incision scar from my last biopsy insicion.  I went to the appointment today and mentioned everything to only be told my cbc and cmb were all normal as well as my tsh levels and that he will see me next spring. I cannot handle this sensation and pain what more can I do? Or what do you suggest?

                I had a couple of surgeries/biopsies to my chest for a mediastinal lymphoma five years ago.
The surgeon cut through the intercostal muscles to get through between the ribs.
Ever since then I have, what feels like a hole in my chest, you can literally poke a finger in between the ribs and when I cough the chest wall protrudes right out the chest. It's a cool party trick, but when I have a coughing fit it really hurts and I have to place a hand on my chest to hold it in.
Has anyone experienced something like this? Am I meant to be left with this 'hole' after a thoracotamy type surgery?

                I have had a swollen lymph node in my neck for over 1/2 a year. I finally had a fine needle biopsy and ultra sound on it today. I won't find out the results for a few days and I am very anxious. The specialist performing the biopsy said it was a swollen lymph node in the parotid gland. I havnt had any symptoms lately of any disease or infection to my knowledge. (I'm a 16 year old female)

-the lymph node is about 2cm big, painless, hard, immovable

-a long time ago (probably last year) I experienced night sweats a few times a month. But I havnt had them anymore.

-used to always wake up with a dry, sore throat, but don't get that anymore either.

-I don't know if it is related but I always get red, bloodshot, sore eyes after going in chlorine pools

-I also experience abdominal pains and an emptiness feeling often.

How long does it take before you experience symptoms of something like lymphoma? If anyone knows anything about what this could be I would really appreciate it.

                Hello. My names Madison. I am 17 years old, 5'6 and 122 lbs. i have ibs possibly Crohns disease or other stomach issues, moderate persistent asthma, history of skin cancer but was removed. I seem to be having a lymph node problem. I had multiple swollen lymph nodes including one right where my jaw starts, some under my jaw near my chin, one on my neck halfway between my collarbone and jaw, one right in front of my ear, I believe there's one in my boob/armpit area, and I have a few in the groin/pelvic area. All of which are different sizes, but all are harder. The biggest sized lymph node I gave is about the size of a nickel/quarter and the littlest is the size of a pea. The lymph nodes have been showing up in different spots, and stay. I've been on antibiotics a couple times and there was no change whatsoever. I had also had blood tests to check if I was anemic, had mono, thyroid disease and HIV. Everything came back fine, except I was on the low side (almost anemic) of the blood test. I'm going to try and make my doctor biopsy a couple of the nodes because I just have a feeling something isn't right. Other symptoms im having are: loss of appetite, itchy skin, extreme fatigue, nausea, diarrhea. The one symptom that is the worst is fatigue. No matter how much sleep I get I am not completely rested and always sleepy. So please let me know what you guys think it could be! Thank you!

                Hey all,

So I have a past with some odd an unexplained symptoms.  They have come and gone but they tend to stick around for several years.We know our bodies and when something is not right.  I admit early on when I started feeling bad I probably was in a panic mode  not knowing what was happening.  After many years of feeling not so good I am not in panic but more so just frustrated.

For the past year or so I developed pressure headaches along with major vertigo and generally feeling unwell.  All the tylenol in the world will not get rid of the headache and pressure.  It seems to come and go but it messes with my vision.  I just feel ill, unwell.  About 6 months ago I was coming down from  a ladder and landed hard on one leg.  Afterwards my hip was in alot of pain.  I figures I sprained it and give it a week or two and it might feel better.    About a month or two later it moved to the other hip.  My hips will hurt pretty bad enough to at times give me a difficult time walking.  It's a deep pinching sensation along with a catching feeling and a bad ache especially at night I have to toss and turn to get comfortable.  Now i think my shoulder is beginning to ache.   The hip problem is not getting better. I am 46.

I have fatigue that is pretty bad.  I can only compare it to the pregnancy fatige that you ladies can understand.  As though you are completely drained of all energy and never get a second wind.    Also lost about 50% of my hair over a 6 yr period with burning itchy scalp.


My mother died of blood cancer.   Would this stuff show up on blood work?  I don't like doctors and try and avoid at all costs however I do have a visit scheduled with a neurologist per my internist next month.  Anyone else have these issues?  I am pretty low key and feel something is very off.

So, do I waste another bucket of energy, money ($200!) and time and go AGAIN to the ER?  Or wait until Mon and maybe see my GP if it's still swollen (she'll just say go to ER I bet).  Advice is so very needed!!  Could this rather large swollen area be from a cold?  It starts on my upper right arm (just above the PICC line scar) to my armpit (which is the most painful) and down my right flank.  

ER vs possible DVT...  Ugh.  If I hadn't been hospitalized & to the ER soooo many times since I got pancreatitis in 2005 from an ERCP, I'd go now.  But it's embarrassing!  They know my name there, just like at Cheers (the old TV show).  So uncertain.  HELP!  Ta, Nibs

I had a yeast infection and convinced myself I had HIV, but my doctor said no and ruled out I did not need a test. Since November I have had swollen lymph nodes in my neck. They are rubbery and I am able to move them around. The largest one is just under my chin to the right. I have had a blood test that came back with slightly high, but nearly normal WBC count. I now for a couple weeks have had a very tight feeling in my left thigh. It is so tight and feels like I just finished a hard workout. When I sit down in certain positions it tends to irritate me and tugs on the outer side of me knee so I move around. I have noticed a ""bulge"" in certain positions and am worried sick. I have been to physio therapy and I've been told to monitor it and that it could be a nerve or spasms due to a prior lower back injury. If it does not go down I will be sent for an ultrasound. I have had 3 MRIs, and a CT scan to rule out back issues which came back fine and nothing was ever noticed... HELP!

I'm female and 25 years old. I've had about six lymph nodes swollen at the sides of my neck (3 on each side) for over a year now, and under my underarms.I've been to the doctor, and he did blood tests which showed my 
lymphocytes were in the normal range.I also had a few lymphathic  drainage massages, and a colon hydrotherapy done which took away the swollen nodes under my arms, and reduced the swelling of the
ones on my neck area. Before I went for the massages and the colon hydrotherapy, I experienced chronic fatigue, and after I did these procedures, my fatigue went away, and I have more energy now. The colon cleanse showed I had pin worms.  However, it's been two months after the massage and the colon hydrotherapy, and the 
swollen lymph nodes by my neck are still here. I feel one by each under arm near the breast area  But I don't have chronic fatigue any more. I'm a full-time university student and married, so often times, I'm under a lot of stress to balance my time and priorities.I'm trying to figure out why they are still swollen.

                Hi, hoping to get some insight here, because I'm really afraid. 
It all started about three months ago with a feeling of a lump in my throat. Not an actual lump, but the feeling of one, right below where my adam's apple would be (I'm female though). I'd feel it on and off through the day, sometimes not so bad, and sometimes very noticeable. When I eat or drink anything it gets better though, the feeling of the lump goes away. Just a few weeks later, I began to feel an aching in the right side in one of my glands, about an 1 - 1 1/2"" down from where my jaw line is. Soon after that I felt the gland swell, it feels round and squishy and I can sort of roll it around. From that point, the aching basically stopped at that location, and I started feeling aching just under my ear. The aching comes and goes. I noticed after that I could feel the gland, but this gland feels different, it feels a little harder and less moveable, although I can move it a tad. I also started to feel aching in the same point under my left ear, but I cannot feel any sort of swollen gland there. From that point I got sick, lasted a weekend, had a mild sore throat, was tired, and at one point I coughed up some white mucus, which greatly relieved the feeling of the lump in my throat. 
Everything seemed to get better for a little while, but then the symptoms came back (and the swelling of the glands stayed, had never left). I went to the ENT, he felt everything and confirmed the gland in my neck was swollen (cervical node), and put a little tube through my nose to check my throat. Said he could see no sign of anything wrong, but he did prescribe amoxicillan for seven days in case of an infection. I took them, felt like I was getting slightly better, but then they seemed to stop working, and I have the same feelings. In addition to this, I have developed pain in my different areas of my throat. Sometimes it seems to ache under my neck and jaw, sometimes in the front of my throat, and the achiness seems to get worse as the day progresses, I will often feel a lot of pressure by my ears, a headache on the right side, feels like my ears pulse sometimes, achiness all in neck. I don't have any sort of fever and generally feel ok otherwise, no cough, can't seem to bring anything up when I try to clear my throat, sometimes my throat feels ever so slightly sore, but it's hard to pinpoint. 
I've been doing a lot of research, finding things on GERD (but I don't have any heartburn), and LPR (but can't figure out why my glands would be swollen because of this or the achiness up near my ears), and a thyroid problem (but still can't figure out why gland in neck would be swollen, and I don't feel any sort of lump where the thyroid would be). 
Please help, any insight would be greatly helpful. I'm scared beyond belief, getting married next week and have postponed having a CT scan (doctor said that would be the next step if antibiotics didn't work) because of the fear. 
Please help. 
Thank you.

Then starting in December i felt a pressure in my groin also feeling of nausea, loss of appetite, and night sweats. Went to my doctor,did an ultra sound and one of my lymnodes on the right side was swollen 1.5 cm did a blood test everything came back norma no infection or anything except for a slightly raised white cell count. She gave antibiotics and said if the pressure didnt go away to call her. Now the pressure is on both sides the lymnode has gotten bigger and the node on the left side is bigger than the right side, still having night sweats and feeling of being of sick. Also my stools have changed theyre narrow very light brown and uncomfotable to perform. Im very worried this has beeen going on for 4 months now dont know to think.

                Hallo,

Back in September I noticed an enlarged lymph node on the left side of my neck located a little over 3 inches down from the ear lobe and slightly behind (which most likely makes it a posterior cervical lymph I think). My guess is that it's been around 1 cm, maybe slightly bigger. Feels movable, slightly ellipsoid / elongated shape, and usually not tender. I honestly don't know if it has grown since then or not, but it's been definitely visible through the skin in certain neck positions (which of course, the OCD that I am, convinces me that it has grown). I also think it may vary slightly in size, feeling, or tenderness depending on time of the day, stress level, etc., but that's too subjective obviously.

Worried about it, I looked for a ""similar"" sized node on the right side to justify the existence of the one on the left side. I did find one, albeit smaller and less noticeable (<1 cm), and a little deeper into the neck, at about the same ~3 in vertical distance, but at the level of the ear lobe, not behind it. If I never got worried about the left one, I would have totally ignored the right one as it does feel normal more or less.

Since September:

- I saw a primary care doctor in December who did standard blood work (CBC, CMP, TSH), chest X-ray, and soft tissue x-ray on neck, all came back ""normal."" Doctor said to not worry about it, it's likely a fibriotic clogging / left over virus clogging, or cat scratch fever. I wasn't convinced, and suggested we do biopsy, but he said he was convinced this is nothing serious.

- I saw another primary care doctor this week (early February) as I am not at ease. I don't think the left one has grown in size, but it has definitely ""grown"" in my mind in terms of awareness and visual discomfort, which somehow makes that part of the body more sensitive (you know that OCD feeling that something is ""wrong"" in that part of the body). Doctor was a little concerned as the left one has been there for many months, and the second one, albeit smaller, is there too. He referred me to ENT doctor for biopsy as this is the only way to really know what's happening. He said this is an unlikely spot for left-over respiratory clogging, although he didn't rule out the cat scratch bacteria.

About me: Healthy, fit 34 year old male, no history of any serious disease, occasional chronic sinus and left ear infections, and very mild reverse psoriasis (shows up occasionally around inner thigh / groin area). Very allergic to cats, and have been exposed to cats 6-7 times over the last 6 months (as well as for 1 year continuously back in 2007/2008). No other symptoms of any kind - no fatigues, sweats, headaches, spleen pain, etc.

Questions to the community:

1) I know this is an alarming situation, so how likely is for this case to be lymphoma? It's kind of disturbing to know that absolutely no symptoms could still mean you have the disease, although it would likely mean it's in early stages I am assuming.

2) Are there other, benign reasons for this? Are there any statistics of malign vs. benign outcomes in these unusual lymph places? At this point, are the statistics in favor or one or the other?

3) During my ENT appointment, I am definitely insisting for a biopsy, and I am sure the ENT would agree. Are there any other tests that can be done before that for guidance?

Thank you for any insights. Needless to say, I am quite worried.

                Hello,

I have been having various issues. I have bad health anxiety as it is, and have convinced myself I am suffering from lymphoma. It all started because I was having lots of aches and pains, in my neck, ribs, arms and back. I somehow convinced myself it was my lymph nodes and ran to the doctor, he sent me for all kinds of blood tests for infection, inflammation, thyroid function, FBC, etcera etcera. All came back completely normal. I calmed down for a week and then suddenly started aching again. This time I started searching in my groin, neck and armpits for swollen glands. I couldn't find any at all. However I have now found a small, and I mean tiny, it's like 0.3cm maximum bump on the muscle in my neck. It is near the top on the left hand side it doesn't ache and is barely noticeable, have to really dig around to find it. It's not on the other side.

I have no other symptoms, except for the fact that I  get a bit sweaty at night sometimes. But I don't think this is related as I have been getting it on and off since I was in my early teens and I am now 28.

user_9775849,ps11,/posts/Leukemia-and-Lymphoma-/Very-strange-Results-from-MRI-and-US/show/2481564,Very strange Results from MRI and US!,"
                I will try to summarize my story.
Approximately two weeks ago i saw two enlarged lymph nodes in the left part of my neck.
I had an ultrasound of my neck, armpit and groin due to two enlarged lymph nodes in the left part of my neck. 
Results of ultrasound:
-	Right part of neck: three enlarged nodes 13*5 mm, 33*8 mm and 9*4 mm
-	Left part of my neck: two enlarged nodes11*4mm and 20*8mm 
-	Left armpit: 13*4 mm
-	Right groin: 10*7 mm
-	Left groin: 7*3 mm

The hematologist was so worry especially because of the biggest lymph nodes (33*8mm) and immediately sent me for doing excisional biopsy. after visiting the surgeon, he told me that he can not touch this node and he will not surgery unless he knows the exact location of this node! so, he sent me for doing MRI of neck with and without contrast. so five days after doing ultrasound i did a MRI of neck.
The results of MRI:
-	Multiple scatter lymph nodes in posterior triangle as well as jugular chain without meeting criteria for adenopathy based on short access diameter.
-	Small node in right submental space (level 1) measures 6mm.
-	Impression:
No evidence of obvious lymph adenopathy based on short access criteria!
This is really strange because the result of MRI did not mention to the 33mm lymph nodes!! Or I can still see the two lymph nodes which are located in the let part of my neck.
Is it possible? What should I do now? Which one is more reliable? MRI or Ultrasound?
I am really confused?
PS: I had horrible case of Mono about 9 months ago and now and I am suffering from abdominal and lower back pain since 1.5 months ago!
and sorry for my English!!!

                Hi guys,

I noticed about 2 months ago that my right tonsil was huge compared to the other one (about 6 times the size) and coveres half of the back of my throat...  i was looking after a feeling of something being ""full"" in my throat... after that I didnt think much of it as there was no pain at all.

yesterday I read an article about lymphoma and that sometimes it can present in one swollen tonsil.  I had a feel around my neck and noticed that I have a swollen lymph node on the same side as the swollen tonsil..  its firm and doesnt hurt when I press on it... its located directly under where the tonsil is...  just on or beside my wind pipe.

recently I have been feeling very run down and weak and have been to the doctors on numerous ocasions but nothing has been found.

I will point this out to my doctor next time I go and see what he says

should I be worried?

I have recently been diagnosed with an inegural hernia and will have to get this fixed at somepoint..

Im wondering now if this could actually be a swollen lymph node..

I also have a hiatal hernia and im wondering if that could be the same case..

im not worried sick but as i am on an oil rig at the moment with no access to a doctor I wondered what you guys could make of it.

thanks

                Hi Everyone, I have been having a small lump or feeling stuck on the left side of my throat with slight ear pain on the same left side very minor. I also noticed a swollen lymph node on same side not sure if its really swollen it feels hardened size of my pinky nail. I went to ENT earlier this month and he checked everything said nothing is growing or infection or wasn't worried about the node so thats a good sign I guess. Recently I have been getting brain confusion, sometimes chills, and major headaches on and off throughout the day. My bloodwork is fine slight low levels of B12 because I do not eat meat. He told me to do salt water gargles 4 times a day. it has been helping a little bit. My major worry is Lymphoma obviously. I am 23 years old do not smoke, barely drink anymore. Another bit of information is I need to get my wisdom teeth pulled out later this month not sure if this is the root of all the problems (dentist and ENT said no). What should I do next? CT scan? Endoscopy? (Had severe heartburn first time in my life with stomach burning dr put me famotidine for 2 weeks went away, sometimes still get minor burning sensation rarely)  Biopsy?

                Hey everyone,

I feel a bit silly for posting on an online community when chances are I don't have leukemia but I'm a bit desperate. I've been searching for a cause of some long-term symptoms for a while but recently some more acute issues have begun that are worrying me.

6 weeks ago, I started getting small bouts of petechiae/purpura. I figured out that's what they were by googling it and then it was recently confirmed by a doctor. They come and go - a handful on my belly or legs or neck, never an overwhelming amount. I did have quite a bit down my neck and shoulders a few days ago and it convinced me to go to the doctor. 

3 weeks ago, I started getting bouts of chills. I've had probably 3-4 bouts of chills since then, I finally invested in a thermometer and during the last one, my temperature went up to 99.5 degrees, which I know isn't high, but my regular temp is 95.5-96 so it's high for me. I also think I've had episodes of minor fevers outside the chills but I can't confirm it (I only bought the thermometer 3 days ago). 

Over the last few weeks I've had fullness after a few bites of food and loss of appetite that has considerably worsened over the last week. I also have abdominal pain that's focused around my middle and mid-upper left side. In the last week as it's worsened, I've lost 6lbs. I've also had a cold for the last 6 days that seems to be lingering. 

I have some bruising but it's not excessive. I also have fatigue (although it's not new), weakness, dizziness (especially postural), my skin seems very translucent these days (veins are visible everywhere), and my nail beds have turned purple/blue over the last few weeks. I've got some joint pain and have woken mid-night with chills and awful hip/leg pain specifically. I'm constantly freezing, which is new for me. I've also had severe headaches over the last few weeks but I do have a disorder that could potentially explain the fatigue, dizziness and definitely the headaches, so they might not be related. Either way, I feel pretty gross, all the time. I don't have excessive bleeding - I had my period last week and while it was heavy, I don't know if it was excessively so, just filled with extra large clots (sorry for the TMI). I had blood work this week and I clotted just fine afterward. I'm either really pale or really flushed (because of hot flashes) so I don't know if I actually look pale? The petechiae/purpura come and go, some days are worse then others - like today, I only found 2-3 new spots, whereas late last week, I had so many I couldn't count them.

After I found the larger patch of petechiae/purpura last week, I went to a walk in clinic and the doctor said we needed to rule out clotting disorders. The doc reviewed my history - I had blood work done in March before I had a very large and serious surgery, and apparently something was up with my INR then (the walk in doc asked if I had the petechiae then and I didn't) but it wasn't enough to postpone my surgery, so I guess it wasn't that worrisome. 

I did the clotting bloodwork this past Friday and I don't have an appt to pick up the results until this Friday - although I'm thinking if it was anything serious, they would've called me? I only started googling the symptoms (bad idea) after I saw the doctor this past Friday and I have freaked myself out because a lot of my symptoms are in line with leukemia. But  wouldn't I have bleeding issues? How quickly does it develop? Would it have affected my INR back in March even if I didn't start having symptoms until early August? Or does it even affect INR (to be honest I don't know what an INR is)? Why would I be having this bouts of petechiae all of a sudden if my bloodwork is normal? And wouldn't my petechiae be getting worse if it was leukemia, not randomly occurring? Chances are the doctor would've called if my bloodwork showed any large abnormalities, correct? 

Again, I'm sorry to bother everyone, I'm just worried and feeling sick and looking for answers. Good luck to everyone!

                Hi,
My husband was sent for an ultrasound after I finally convinced him to get a groin lump examined. He has had it for around 15 years, since his late teens. He estimates that it has probably quadrupled in size since when he first noticed it. Due to a childhood history of having lumps in his back, he did not give it much thought. After finding out his family carries the brca1 mutation, I was doing research on what if any consequence that could have for males and ended up reading about lymphoma. Between the lymph node looking lump, his having had mono, and random things such as weight loss for no reason, skin rashes upon contact, and night sweats, I thought he should see a doctor for the first time in his adult life (for non emergency reasons, that is). His blood tests results were normal.

So, the ultrasound findings:
Hypoechoic nodule measuring 2.4x1.4x4.9cm
No evidence for increased vascularity
Nodule is well defined and does not extend into deep soft tissues or adjacent muscles
This may represent a lymph node or possibly a well-defined soft tissue tumor. Excisional biopsy is suggested.


I guess I had thought the US would at least show whether it was a lymph node but I guess not. Do those results mean anyone to anyone here? His primary care physician only received the results for his other unrelated scan - we picked this one up today, so we have to wait until Monday to speak to the doctor.

                Hello! My name is Madison, and I need to figure out why my lymph nodes are swollen. I'm 17 years old and 120 lbs. (5'6) I am a severe asthmatic. (That is the only health issue recorded) So I have quite a few lymph nodes that are swollen and hard. I first noticed my ""first"" lymph node on my neck. It was by where my jaw connects to my neck and its sort of hard to feel. It's about the size of a nickel, and quite hard. That lymph node has been present for months now. A couple months ago I noticed another lymph node right beside it with the same hardness, and just a tad smaller. I then noticed some squishy, dime sized lymph nodes in my pelvic area. I then noticed another hard, dime sized lymph node on the opposite side of my neck, and one I believe on the side of my breast. I now just noticed yesterday that I have a quarter size (estimate) lymph node directly in front of my left ear. It's hard, and moves a little. Here's some more information: I get sick quite easily, Just in the past 2 moths I've had 3 ear infections that required two types of antibiotics and a couple chest infections (pneumonia & bronchitis). My infections seem to be long lasting & and more severe. (My ear infection went from a simple swimmers ear to almost infecting my mastoid bone in just a couple of days) I've also had tests done for the lymph nodes. I had a CBC, which came back normal. Also, a thyroid function tests and a mono spot test which all came back that those weren't the problems. My doctors just gave up on it I guess and Id like to know what could be causing my swollen lymph nodes! And I thought this would be the right place.

Since the valve surgery have been on coumadin, in june it inr dropped to 1.2 for no reason.... had a stroke.

Your blood had positive screening, supplemental and confirmatory test results for antibodies to Human T-cell Lymphotropic Virus (HTLV).

My doctor reviewed these findings with an infectious diseases specialist and felt no further testing was needed.  Any thoughts on this?

                Okay, really flipping out here. I'm a 22 year old guy whose been having some weird symptoms for a while. It started with finding blood on my toilet paper three months back, accompanied with sharp pain with passing a stool. That seemed like a textbook fissure, and wouldn't you know, the blood on the toilet paper went away. But the stool still looks, usually, a mix of a dark-brown (maybe maroonish) and light red/orange-tan. No blood in the toilet. I eat spaghetti often, if that explains the red color, but otherwise it seems bloody to me.

Starting a few days ago I started getting really nervous. I was talking with a friend of mine who's a doctor about some joint pain I was having; cracking them is a nervous tick, and I had overcracked them in the span of an hour, but some fingers I wasn't really excessively trying to crack starting aching too. Possibly psychosomatic, I don't know. Two days ago, I could feel a few (three; one on each lower side of my neck and one in the middle of the left) lymph nodes, but my friend said if none are larger than a centimeter/half-an-inch they're nothing to worry about; none are. Yesterday I started having pains in my right shoulder, the shoulderblade, and just that whole area around it. I slept on it and put pressure on it laying on my bed (on my laptop) most of that day, but it seemed disproportionately painful to me. It hurt when I strained on the toilet (I weirdly developed pretty heavy constipation after, on my friend's advice, upping the fiber), or even so much as yawned or sneezed. Today I woke up with a slight sore throat and have had recurring slight, dull pains in my lower-left stomach/side, my upper-left leg, and my lower-right (and to a lesser extent lower-left) ribcage.

I've had no fever recently, no weight loss whatsoever, not really much loss of appetite.

I should add that, in terms of family history: my maternal grandpa has had skin cancer before in his late 70s, and a paternal uncle of mine struggled with cancer (no idea what kind) recently in his early 50s.

IBS seems like it may match the symptoms better, but the bone aching does worry me.

i went to emergency and they were suspected to appendicitis. they took a CT scan, blood test and urine test and everything was clear!!! but 10 days after, in addition to my abdominal i have pain in my lower part of my back. i have read that abdominal pain and low back pain without any explanation are sign of lymphoma!!!! today i went to see another doctor. she told me that she can not feel any nodes in my neck but she confirmed that my right part of my neck is inflamed due to inflammation of my muscles in my neck because of mono (would it be possible!!!!?) she sent me again for another CT scan and blood test! i am so scared now! is it possible to develop lymphoma just 8 months after mono?!! i have also low fever!

A couple weeks ago I woke up with a massive headache that didn't want to go away and I hurt Everywhere too but mainly down the back of my thighs and legs. I could roll over in bed but it hurt way too much to get out of it.   

I've also had a low grade fever (99.0, I usually run 97.0) for a month now that doesn't want to go away and my head hurts a lot :( 

And didn't think anything of it but I went from 272# to 236# in 2013 and 236# to 224# in 2014. I was 224# on Jan. 2nd and am 221# as of this past wed. I need to lose weight but am not trying and pretty much eat what I want since I'm still learning how to cook. PB&J isn't helping as far as eating well goes, but my weight keeps dropping like crazy. 

And I don't eat a lot either. My past doc. wanted me eating 3 times a day to keep my sugars regulated but some days all I'm hungry for is 2 granola bar.  Or like yesterday all I ate was a piece of cake and 4 small meatballs. It's been like that for at least 1.5 years. They can't make me eat 3 times a day when I'm not hungry. 

So far this winter, I was sick the first week of Nov. and then for 2 weeks starting the day after Christmas. That is a lot better than last year. 

My new doc. I saw wed. is running a CBC. I don't know of all my past blood tests but on the ones I do know of, my white blood cell count, hemoglobin,hSorry this is so long. I'm 26. 

A couple weeks ago I woke up with a massive headache that didn't want to go away and I hurt Everywhere too but mainly down the back of my thighs and legs. I could roll over in bed but it hurt way too much to get out of it.   

I've also had a low grade fever (99.0, I usually run 97.0) for a month now that doesn't want to go away and my head hurts a lot :( 

And didn't think anything of it but I went from 272# to 236# in 2013 and 236# to 224# in 2014. I was 224# on Jan. 2nd and am 221# as of this past wed. I need to lose weight but am not trying and pretty much eat what I want since I'm still learning how to cook. PB&J isn't helping as far as eating well goes, but my weight keeps dropping like crazy. 

And I don't eat a lot either. My past doc. wanted me eating 3 times a day to keep my sugars regulated but some days all I'm hungry for is 2 granola bar.  Or like yesterday all I ate was a piece of cake and 4 small meatballs. It's been like that for at least 1.5 years. They can't make me eat 3 times a day when I'm not hungry. 

So far this winter, I was sick the first week of Nov. and then for 2 weeks starting the day after Christmas. That is a lot better than last year. 

My new doc. I saw wed. is running a CBC and a couple other things. I don't know of all my past blood tests but on the ones I do know of, my white blood cell count is always high. So are the absolute lymphs, hemoglobin, hematocrit, eosinophils, EOS #, mannose-binding lectin, complement total (CH50), and absolute neutrophils.

                Hi. I have been on this site for more than a year now. Cut the long story short. I had a protected  encounter with CSw in September 2013 after Wich I got sore throat whole body itching and underarm pain etc. All my labs showed nothing including HIV (I tested till 7 months) however it was revealed I have diabetes. M internist told me I have pain in armpits both sides of the ribs and groin and thighs due to neuropathy. After two month a lump appeared on my front ribs 2 inches down my right breast. Two lumps behind my both arms one small lump near my epitrochlear area. got them checked and the doctor said its lipoma not lymph nodes. I have these small bumps all over  now on my stomach and thighs where vertical inguinal lymph nodes are.but they are tiny barely more Than 1.5 Cm. Went to an oncologist he palpated my armpits and groin but he couldn't find enlargedlymph nodes. He said to go to a psychologist. However for my peace of mind he asked me to take a color xray and an ultrasound. Again I have excruciating pain in these areas. Is it really neuropathy or am I pressing too hard? And these bumps have not grown in size since past 12 months. What do u guys think it is ?

                I'm gonna sumerize this as briefly as possible and I'm going to say on front end I have been to several drs including oncologist who are following me aggressively Bc of possible cancer. I'm not one of those ppl who feel a lump are just in panic mode posting. Here goes... I'm 26 female I had a baby 18 months ago I had a rough pregnancy and during second half was discovered I have severe anemia so bad I was hospitalized and nothing seemed to help it. During second half of pregnancy I started to develop horrible drenchung night sweats which I attributed to pregnancy and a couple swollen nodes. I just let it go then after  my daughter was born I felt like I got hit by a bus so tired 24/7 I ached everywhere the night sweats just got worse terrible pain in left side more swollen nodes. My gyn said it was hormones going back to normal. Two months later I go to gp she did cbc severely anemic still said that was it and made me feel nuts. Everything just kept getting worse so I got a second opinion now 4 months post delivery, internalist said my side hurt Bc my speen was swollen she did full work up and I did 7 rounds antibiotics total even though I had no obvious infection. I was tested for every auto disease and infection al neg. I have high blood protein but 6-8 months with several nodes still big she sent for biopsy fna ( I know bad test) said they didn't get enough tissue to be sure but looked like excessive Lambda ultra sound said of the one they took it from (really two were matted there 1.3 sm each in posterior cervical area) hypoechoic rim but hyperchoic helium. Pathology suggested follow up so my dr sent me to hemo onc he said the area they are in is worry some they re did cts and blood did a iron transfusion. The dr said he suspected indolent lymphoma and did bond marrow asp which was good but showed difference in size of rbc. He said my igm protein was high  but not myloma high but def abnormal and I had granulcytopenia in flow test. He said every 4 months he follows and scans me fast forward year later to now still have same swollen nodes night sweats fatigue side pain and now bladder fistula (prob unrelated) I had full gi work up nothing but strange inflamation in ilieum but no gi disease (had geno test). Had my scan last week my spleen has grown 1 cm from last scan now 14.5 (u can see from looking at my stomach) however so stones it gets even bigger (my dr has seen it) but always palpable and swollen. And scan said ""again several stable shotty nodes seen in nevk region"" and chest said stable but increased lobulated density of anterior superior mediastinum and two 2.1 cm low density ovoid structures in pelvic wall needs ultra sound to rule out necrotic nodes. Spleen more enlarged from last scan. My internalist has ordered full blood work up again Bc she said this is not normal and could be indolent lymphoma. Esp given spleen issues and location of nodes. Anyone with similar experiences or know what to make of this? Please ? Also on my onc paper work under diagnosis I saw term inc. castlemans disease does anyone know anything about castlemans disease?

                I am a Vietnam veteran and was diagnosed with CLL in 1994 (There has already been an Agent Orange/CLL connection made).  I began suffering various skin cancers a couple of years before and have been through many mohs surgeries.  My oncologists agrees that CLL and Skin cancers are most probably related to my exposure to Agent Orange during my tour in Vietnam.
FYI! I was also diagnosed with Crohns disease in 1985 and suffered a severe bout of Shingles (hospitalized) in 1999.
Early last year I injured my wrists in two separate, very minor accidents.  Both wrist became swollen, became very warm to the touch and were, of course, extremely painful.   I was advised to consult with an orthopedic doctor as well as a rheumatologists and they both ordered MRIs and Xrays of both hands and wrists.  The results indicated the soft tissue in both wrists had been attacked and completely eroded by my immune system(?) and/or some undetermined form of of rheumattoid arthritis. They, and every expert they talked with, were mystified by the event.  Eight months later both wrists are locked and the fingers on my right hand stiff.
Question:  Could there be a link between the disability/damage to my wrists (rheumatoid arthritis) and my exposure to Agent Orange (Dioxin)?
Thanks for your assistance

It feels soft, small and i can move it to some extent, i just want to know if this is something serious, i've had it for 3 weeks now and it feels like its gotten somewhat smaller (or its going deeper idk). I've had no other symptoms other than i started coughing today, but i think that got triggered by some dust.

So is this something serious, what should i do?

I am 23 and have not had health insurance so I avoid the doc and stick to home holistic health. Recently have been obsessing over swollen lymph nodes is what I believe they are. One in right groin for year or so and another in my right anterior and medial elbow directly above crease. Both are large and firm at touch. I never thought anything of it until I started realizing I havr persistent symptoms that are getting worse. Terrible headaches and ringing in ears..usually in right ear. Energy levels have dropped and I have sudden stomach aches along with fatigue.  Haven't felt like myself and am wondering if alleged lymph nodes are something more to be concerned about. Also what steps to take next. Thank you for your help

                I'm a 21-year-old male. For the past few months I've been experiencing some pressure under my left rib. The pressure is sometimes associated with slight pain. I've also felt the same on the right side, though less frequently. This pressure has been accompanied by a sharp pain in the center of my lower chest, as well as some back rib pain and gas. In the past week, I have started to feeling both discomfort and pain in my armpits. The pain sometimes travels to my arm and hands. I've felt around, yet I don't seem to have any swollen nodes. A couple days ago (since my doctor put me on Prilosec) I also started having similar symptoms in my neck and throat that sometime come with an earache. Again, I do not feel any swelling.

Does this sound like lymphoma or leukemia. My doctor seemed to think it was simply heartburn (hence the reason he prescribed me Prilosec), and he didn't even bother to check my armpits. I'm going to another doctor next week when I get back from break (I'm currently home from college). Is there anything I should know before going?

                To start I'm a 23 year old male. About a month and a half ago I had a sinus infection that went on for about 3 weeks, I underwent 14 days of antibiotic treatment with 8 days worth of predniSONE at the start of the antibiotic cycle. At the time I never even tried to feel my lymph nodes and the doctor (ENT) I went to never mentioned them being swollen.

Now to today: My sinus infection is gone, I still have a stuffy nose and post nasal drip, but other than that no symptoms.

3 days ago I noticed a lump in my neck just below the jaw line, that is lined up with the front of my ear. This lump is about 1cm to 1.5cm wide, its moveable (as in when i put my finger on it in the middle of it, it will move to one side of my finger to the other). There is no pain and I don't think I would even notice it being there if i didn't happen to feel it the other day.

Now my question is; Is this normal for 1 lymph node to be swollen like this after a sinus infection? Should I even worry about this? how long should I wait to go see my doctor? and if i must go to a doctor, would an ENT doc be my best bet to get this figured out?

                Hi,

My 83 year old dad at his routine physical was told that his WBC was 55,000 and that he had leukemia.  He had more blood tests and the report came back that it was possibly Chronic myleoproliferative disease.  Meanwhile, we went for a second opinion.  That dr. ordered a bone marrow biopsy. The results came back inconclusive.  Today my dad is having a gastric ct scan of chest and abdomen.  Are they looking for lymphoma or what?  He presents with fatigue and has a little cough (had for a long time...was told it was related to his cholestral meds).  He was also diagnosed with a low thryoid (like me) and put on levothryoxine.  

I'm confused...just what might they be looking for?  I'm not getting clear answers.

Thanks so much for any help that you can give me.  We are all really worried.  He is generally in great health, even doing well after his second stint in his artieries in fall of 2006.

Regards,

Sean

                New Year is turning up abnormal. Abdominal CT scan without contrast to look at head of pancreas where previous report in 2012 noted small anomaly ended up resulting in radiologist noting multiple lesions or possible 'cancer' on my spleen.  Recent blood workup showed low globulin but high albumin/globulin ratio - 2.7 and high IgG, everything else within normal range.  Albumin is 4.9. The radiologist recommended more scans/tests so my doctor has ordered CT with and without contrast including pelvis, pancreas, liver.

I am chronically fatigued, have had diarrhea for over a year, gallbladder removed in 2012 which was acute. My skin itches and I have had within the past several months severe pain in my right hip and even touching the area or trying to lay on that side on and off.  I have had back pain in the same area which my doctor noted on my right side. I had an unusual skin rash on my wrist several months back that I took a picture of with my phone but then only recently deleted it.

I have had three colds in the last two months and my asthma or breathing has bothered me during about the same time which I have not had to request or use an inhaler for several years. Nor have I had a real cold in about 3 years.

I am a brain tumor survivor, brain aneurysm survivor, had an A/V malformation removed from my left calf along with the soleus muscle which resulted in a DVT, then a double pulmonary emboli.

So, long story short, could I have an infection or lymphoma.

                Hi. I've been having some body pains over the past year and a half. I know that occasional body pains are normal which is why I've brushed it off for so long but recently it's become quite a bother. My main areas of pain are around my lower left ribs (which is a sharp pain), above my ankles (dull, achy pain) and near where my thigh connects to my hip (also an achy-type pain). I've had reoccurring migraines for nearly five years but I'm not sure if that's relevant or not. I've lost five pounds in a couple weeks because I've been eating less (unintentionally). Overall I just feel really, really tired. I do have iron deficiency anaemia but I was wondering if there may be another cause for the fatigue, palpitations, shortness of breath. I've also begun having heavier periods. Like instead of having them last 5 days, they'll last over 10 days and for most of those ten days I will have a heavy flow. Out of curiosity I googled my symptoms and the results said ""leukaemia"" which kind of worried me. Maybe I'm overreacting but I was just wondering if anyone had any ideas whether it could be leukaemia or something else. I have insomnia but when I wake up in the middle of the night I'm almost always drenched in my own sweat despite the fact that it's not even warm. Thank you so much in advance.

                I am a 25 year old male and have noticed an approximately 1 centimetre in diameter, movable, lymph node behind my right ear. I have been able to feel it for about 3 months. It hasn't seemed to grow in size either, although its difficult to tell.  And I have not had any infection or anything like that since I have felt it.  Planning to make an appointment with specialist, but it isn't for a while.

I have been told that because its movable, it is not serious. Is that true? I'm just worried it could be some type of cancer.  Is it common for lymphoma to start in lymph nodes behind the ear??  I have no other symptoms.

                (I have cross posted this in pediatrics)

A couple months ago we took our son (7) to his GP about the fact that he seemed to be leaking urine, not large amounts, but enough that you can smell it on him in the morning, sometimes at the end of the day. They did a urinalysis etc... and all was clear. We went back for follow up a month ago, and he did a physical exam, and noted that my son's lymph nodes in the groin area were a bit enlarged. At the time he decided to repeat the urinalysis, to check again for infection, and noted that if there was an infection (especially down there), that it could cause some swelling of the lymph nodes, which would go away within a couple weeks. He wanted to see us back in four weeks to check on the lymph nodes. (The urinalysis was again clear). So we went back yesterday, and the lymph nodes are no better, in fact it appears as though one is even larger. It only seems to be his groin ones, a few in the area are swollen, worse on one side. They are completely painless. There's no history of recent illness of any kind, no injury. Two of them are swollen enough that you can see them when he stands up, plain as day. The largest appears to be about 1"" long now. 

He ordered immediate blood work checking for CBC and a bunch of other things, and has sent an immediate referral to a urologist. In the meantime, I'm not stupid. I know what swollen lymph nodes can mean. I know it could be other things, but I'll admit I'm worried. I know one of the symptoms can be sweating at night - which my son has been complaining of. Sometimes he gets a bit short of breath, oddly enough not so much when he's playing, but when he's reading. He'll be reading and have to stop and catch his breath. I can't really think of anything else that stands out to me. He's always so healthy. 

Anyways, I don't know what I'm looking for... input? Suggestions as to other things it could be? How big should a lymph node normally be in that area for a child? Also, to be certain that everything is ruled out, what tests should we be asking for?

                I started with significant right side neck pain on 12-19. I had to come home and put heat on my neck and my husband rubbed the right side of my back for 39 minutes or so. The following morning I woke up with a very throat on the right side. Later that day I noticed that I had an enlarged posterior cervical lymph node that was swollen. It was less than 1 cm. on 12-21, I was coughing and sneezing and decided to get a massage. I got a massage on 12-21 and the therapist said that she felt the swollen lymph node. The performed a deep tissue massage on my neck and upper back for 1 hour. The massage was painful!!  The therapist said my neck was so tight that she could not give me a massage bc my neck was so tight. She said that the deep tissue massage would prompt lymphatic drainage. Well, I woke up on 12-22, and noticed several more swollen lymph nodes on the right side of my neck !  Will massaging the neck cause more swollen lymph nodes?  I never noticed this before after getting a massage.  But they again, I never felt my neck before until I had significant pain on 12-19.   I'm concerned over the  number of posterior cervical lymph nodes that are now swollen.  Is it common to have several posterior cervical lymph nodes swollen in a chain from a cold?  I must admit, I can't stop palpating my neck and I'm finding more and more posterior lymph nodes which appear to be swollen. I also noticed suprclavicular lymph nodes that I can feel. I can't feel any nodes on the left side, just the right. Is it normal to feel suprclavicular lymph nodes?  Is it normal to have a chain of posterior cervical lymph nodes that are swollen?   I'm a 48 year old female.

                I wanted to ask about the accuracy in diagnosing low grade lymphoma with FNA . I have heard it is not so accurate for a low grade lymphoma which the doctor suspectsit is  if anything at all . I have been also given the chance of a excitional biopsy but I am very worried about the complications such as injury to ther blood vessel it is sitting on and bleeding out and going into shock . I am also concerened because it is relativey small node it may be hard to find . I am also worried about the anethetic because I have a heart condition and have low tolerance to medication .

                I am in the Air Force and have an assigned PCM who has to refer me for any specialty care and recently I have had some problems that I am very worried about and don't know what to do.

I saw my PCM 15 December with report of a swollen armpit lymph node (swelling size of golf ball, hard mass inside of swelling is smaller).  He said the we should wait it out for a month to see if it was a bacterial infection.  He ordered a couple blood tests.  A couple days later the pain from the swollen armpit was too much and I went to the ER.  The ER doctor did a quick blood test and said the general blood counts looked fine.  The ER doctor gave me some antibiotics.  I got my results from my CBC yesterday and my doctor said it looked fine, but there are certain qualities that worry me.

High EOS % 8.1 (normal range 1-7)
High MCH 52 (normal range 26-34)
High AST 47 (normal range 5-44)
High LDH 350 (normal range 100-333)

Also the swelling in my armpit hasn't changed at all, even after 2 days of antibiotics.  Now I am paying more attention to symptoms and every morning when I wake up I am shaking with chills in bed even though my house temperature is fine.  Who knows how long the chills have been happening because it's not something bad enough to note, I just always wake up and immediately get in a hot shower.

What should I do?  My doctor says he wants me to wait, should I press for a second opinion?

                Iam a 24 yr old boy
1.Iam having cold from more than 3months and inside my right nose there is some hard covering formed due to which Iam not able to breathe through my right nose.
2.secondly,Iam a college going student and stay in mess along with other friends of mine due to which I cannot have my food in correct time and whether I have food or not 24hours there will be gas in my stomach due to which i have chest pain sometimes.
3.Third, and most important point is that my glands in neck have sollen from both sides.

I consulted a doctor and he told me to do blood test,sputum test,ECG and USG neck test.I guess all my reports are normal except that my monocyte count is 0 whereas normal range(02-10).Is there any problem with this count? and my blood report for serum creatinine is 1.3 whereas(0.5-1.2mg/dl).Is this a very big problem?

and last very important report where Iam scared is that my USG neck report says that ""MULTIPLE NODES NOTED IN LEFT POSTERIOR TIANGLE,LEFT LEVEL II AND III GROUPS,LARGEST MEASURING 14.9*4.7mm
ENLARGED LYMPH NODES ALSO NOTED IN RIGHT POSTERIOR TRIANGLE,LEVEL II AND III GROUPS,LARGEST MEASURING 17.6*11.0mm""

Iam going to visit my doctor along with this reports tomorrow but Iam very scared.What does this really mean?Is it Leukemia or something.Just help me someone please.Iam not even having the guts to face my doctor

                About a year ago I developed what I called an allergy to alcohol.  That is to say that after the first swallow of any alcoholic beverage (I have tried them all) I get this awful ache like feeling in my neck, chest, back, and arms.  It starts about a minute or so after the first swallow and then is gone in about 10 min or so.  It is unpleasant enough that I don't take another drink.  I researched any alcohol related allergies similar to this and the ONLY that I came up with over and over again is Hodgkins disease.  In about August I noticed a swollen lymph node in the posterior triangle region.  I believe it's the cervical chain.  It just kind of popped up.  I had not been sick with anything since the summer of 2006.  The ent said it's about 11mm and described it as firm, rubbery, and moveable and that I shouldn't worry about since it is not painful.  Does anyone know or has anyone ever heard of alcohol pain being caused by anything other than Hodgkins?  Ant advice would be greatly appreciated.
Thank you

                Hallo,

I don't see a section on lymph nodes under ""Doctor's Forum"", so I am asking my question here:

I am a healthy 33-year old male, and I have recently noticed one slightly enlarged lymph node (around 1 cm or maybe just slightly bigger) in the lower left neck area behind the ear (I am guessing a posterior cervical node). I think it's been there for months if not years as I have had frequent respiratory problems over the years (chronic sinus infections, removed third tonsil as a kid, bacterial infection in nose area earlier this year, etc.). It's actually my girlfriend who pointed it out upon touch, otherwise it hasn't bothered me in any way. In certain neck positions it protrudes slightly through the skin.

Went to the doctor, he guessed the node was inflamed due to a prior respiratory infection, but never shrank back which is not uncommon. He did blood work (CBC, CMP, TSH) and ordered soft tissue X-rays on chest and neck. All came back ""normal"", so he has no further concerns on anything serious (lymphoma, etc.) and no need for further testing. 

My question: Is it normal to have one enlarged lymph node permanently? Can this really be due to a prior infection and nothing else? Would you ever need to do a biopsy in cases like that?

I pushed the doctor whether we need biopsy, and he said he is confident we don't need one at all, but me being the OCD Hypochondriac that I am, I cannot setlle until I get a second opinion.

Any insights would be welcome, thank you.

                I am a 43 year old male with crohns disease, pancreatitis, arthritis, etc. I am looking for answers from medical professionals really. My right testicle is swollen the size of a pool ball and has a knot on it, now my left testicle also has knot. I just had a CT Scan of my whole abdomen because my Lipase and Amylase where both about 6 x's the high should be. The pancreas looked normal supposedly but there were enlarged lymph nodes in my lower right abdomen. I was on Cymzia for my crohns and never noticed these until I started it. I got looking and found out it has been n\known to cause Lymphnodic cancer. But my crohns doctors keep blowing it off even though my WBC are high and my RBC's are a little low. I had two test ran to take pics of testicles and had one urologist say he looked at a single pic and decided they are benyine (SP) I thought you would have to byopsie totell that and now I have knot on left when I didn't before. Of course this doctor did no test not even urine and worked for a hospital I had told I might be talking to a lawyer already. Should I be worried about this or not. Oh by the way, I am having a very hard and painful time urinating, and supposedly my bladder, prostate, and kidneys were unremarkable or ok according to the CT Scan.

                Hello,

I'm a 3 and half year(since last date of my treatment 08/11) Hodgkin's lymphoma (stage 2B nodular sclerosis on right side of my neck)  survivor. Everything was normal till 2 weeks back before I started noticing a eye floater in my left eye. I rushed to ophthalmologist and he dilated my eye and said everything is normal and nothing to worry. But after that I started developing a pain in my left eye and left part of my head and nose(which is now better than last week) and I again rushed to another ophthalmologist for second opinion and  
this time I asked her to check my vision too. She prescribed me new pair of glasses and said my left eye glasses are strong and that might be the reason for this. She then did slit lamp test and indirect Ophthalmoscopy with lens in my eye after numbing it and said everything is fine.

Its been a week now and I still have that pain around my eye and left side of head which I thought can be a concern and scheduled an appointment with my oncologist. I had a follow up check up 2 months back in October and everything was normal and my oncologist asked me for symptoms and all my blood tests CBC, CMP, LDH, Sedimentation Rate (esr), TSH are picture perfect. He also said that hodgkins lymphoma spreading to CNS is very very rare and everything should be normal but due to my curiosity and anxiety he ordered an MRI scan and now I am waiting for call to schedule appointment for that. It should be a week from now for MRI scan and results of that. 

So, after reading my para's is this a concern? I am asking for opinions.

I also have canker sores and painful swollen lymph nodes and have not been feeling good at all? Is there something wrong that I should bring up at the doctors?

                I was wondering if anyone had ever heard of a systemic fungal infection or indeed any illness that happens to have the exact symptoms of advanced Hodgkin's lymphoma (searing back pain for one year, proliferation of infections in months prior to pain and indeed since, itching worse than chickenpox, shingles or infections, swollen lymph nodes, loss of 90 lbs, joint pain, debilitating fatigue) and yet could remain undetected by bloodwork and mris of thoracic and lumbar spine and of the brain (still waiting for cervical), as well as visits to doctors of many different disciplines including dermatologists, hematologists, psychologists, and endocrinologists. So far I have only learned that I have scalp eczema. I also have had a stomach ulcer, mono (several times showing up as active in the blood), and rheumatoid arthritis, all of which I understand to be risk factors in addition to my age and sex, 28 yr old male. Lately I cannot even get my primary to see me, last time he did he commented the lymph node in my throat, measuring 5 cm, is ""normal size."" Hail Mary here, anyone have any possible thoughts or experiences that could possibly shed light on what this is? bloodwork has shown i am anemic and have elevated liver enzymes but I guess no one is concerned as to why. i dunno, i keep just trying to live my life and hope this will go away as i'm told it's psychological but I truly fail to see that, and those who are qualified to give such mental evaluations laugh when I tell them this (well, after a repore is struck of course)... and it just keeps progressing in the exact manner that lymphoma would, as I have recently read a few stories that sound almost the same as mine. any advice or support would be greatly appreciated, thank you so much!

                I have a few swollen lymph nodes on my neck and one right above my left collarbone. I have had one swollen node on my neck for years. I had it checked out by a doctor a few years ago and he said he wasn't concerned because of the size. He didn't check my blood or run any tests. I didn't question him. For the past few weeks I have felt unwell. While rubbing my shoulders one night after work I felt the swollen lymph node above my collarbone which prompted me to check the rest of my body. The previous one on the front of my neck feels like it has grown into another swollen lymph node right above it. I also have another one on the back of my neck on the right side. I have no idea how long they have been there. The other night after work I decided to take a shot of whiskey and almost immediately I felt a throb in the places where they are swollen.  It also hurt in my right shoulder as well as my left shoulder. It felt like I needed to massage my shoulders to help the pain. I have had some night sweats but nothing too severe. And when I'm in bed at night it seems like my lower legs want to itch. I have a doctors appointment Tuesday. I really don't know what to think. I am a 35 year old woman. This is the first time I have felt ill in a very long time. Am I just being paranoid?

                I went to the doc today to see why I have felt so ill lately. I have several lymph nodes that are swollen and I believe that is the reason I feel bad. He comes in the room and starts asking about my family history. I answered his questions the best I could. He asks why I'm there and I start to explain to him my symptoms. I start telling him about the other night when I took one shot of whiskey and it instantly hurt the knots on my neck and around my shoulders. He looks at me and laughs. I am running a fever today. I have had a fever for the past week that won't seem to go away. He has no answers. He started to feel around on my neck and said he couldn't feel anything! There is a knot in my neck the size of a golf ball. You can see it sticking out. But he couldn't feel it. I didn't know that he was in the process of moving his practice to another town. If I would have known that I would not have wasted my time and gas. I am so discouraged right now. He made me feel silly. I know my body and I know there is something wrong. Has anyone else looking for help and answers been kicked in the teeth by a doctor?

                Posted this in the wrong forum first. Ok, I guess the title sounds stupid because nobody can diagnose me over the internet. But I'm worried. Mortified would be a better word. I've just turned 21 years old and am expecting a potential cancer diagnosis over the coming weeks. About a month ago I noticed that my right tonsil was swollen, so I immediately visited my doctor the next day.. he had a look, said it was nothing to worry about and sent me on my way. two weeks later, I visited again complaining that it hadn't gone down and I could feel a hard lymph node in my neck so he scheduled me for some blood tests. Two weeks later (today) I returned to find out the results of my blood tests and to discuss this tonsil further (the lymph node in my neck is now bigger and can be felt easily.) The doctor is scheduling me to see an ENT specialist within the next 1-2 months so I can find out what's going on here. I saw an ENT specialist about 5 months ago for an unrelated issue and nothing was detected then, but still. He said it's ""definitely not cancer"" because my blood tests haven't shown any abnormalities and lymphoma always shows an abnormality in the blood. I'm scared. If it's not cancer why would he send me to a specialist? My only symptoms over the last few weeks are that I keep getting coughs/colds. I will fight them off, then immediately get another one... but whatever. This lymph node in my neck though DOES NOT HURT. Doesn't that all but confirm that I'm totally screwed? I'm really in the dark here so if anybody can shed any sort of light on this it would be great. What are the actual odds that I could have cancer? I don't know the statistics and I can't find any. I really am going out of my mind here.

                Hi I am new to this part of the forum. I was diagnosed with Stage 3 follicular lymphoma almost 2 years ago. It was initially discovered through a routine physical. I had and still have no symptoms and I am currently just doing a watch and wait. I was seen and the diagnosis made at Sloan Kettering in NYC. 
My question to others is do they find that they find that they easily catch colds and get sick very easily? I am wondering since lymphoma is in your lymph system which is part of the immune system does this make it easier for me to get sick? I eat healthy, take various supplements, make and drink kefir, kombucha, saurkraut, Kimchi, etc. all in an effort to give my immune system all the help it can get and still I am THAT guy at work who catches everything. I figure there has to be a correlation. Does anyone else find this to be true?

                My 8 year old daughter had a left cervical lymph node enflamed and swollen for over a year and a half.  Just recently the node was removed for biopsy.  The node came back with reactive follicular hyperplasia and sinus histiocytic hyperplasia, but showed markers for different lymphomas. 2-3 days after surgery, another lymph node near the same area popped up.  This lymph node is very hard and fixed, the lymph node that was removed was pliable and much softer.  We go back to her pediatrician this Friday,and she is going to send us for an ultrasound and then go from there.  The ENT/surgeon was stumped about this new node, and by speaking with her pediatrician, she is as well.

A little over 2 months ago I noticed that I had a bump directly below my left earlobe. I assume its a lymph node. However, It has remained swollen and is often bigger in the morning when I wake up. I also have been getting headaches often, and only on one side of my head, the same side and the swollen lymph node.
I went to the doctor and she suggested I get and ultrasound of it. 
What is she looking for in the ultrasound? Are my headaches related to the lymph node? Are there any other symptoms I should be looking for? What do you think the cause could be? 
Thanks

                Hi, 

I have fever for 3weeks which have now gone for 3 weeks. 
Did 4 blood test over the 2,3 and 5th weeks with the following result. 

1st test(2nd week): Went to A&E as advised by GP as was having ongoing fever for 10 days, even after last 3 days of trying levoflaxin. Wbc count was within normal range, but absolute lymphocyte count is elevated at 3.5 x 10 9/L. Fever peak at around 38.5oC usually in the evening. Suspect viral fever which will go away on its on. 

2nd test(3rd week): Went to A&E again a week later as fever not subsided. Wbc elevated to 12.75 x 10 9/L and absolute lymphocyte count rise to 9.18 x 10 9/L with eosinophils and basophils lightly elevated at 0.73 and 0.46 x 10 9/L respectively. Reactive lymohcyte was at 5%. No other symptoms beside chills when the fever kicks in but resolves with paracetamol. Occsional cough and flu but not persistent. Still suspect viral fever. 

3rd test(end of 3rd week) : Was referred to general medicine specialist and did a blood test again 4 days later. Wbc was still elevated but drop to 10.4 x 10 9/L. Lymphocyte absolute drop but still elevated at 6.5 x 10 9/L. Reactive lymphocyte also drop to 2%. Eosinophils and basophils also drop, but still lightly elevated. Fever started subsiding but have been having macular rash on both feet(more on the lower limb and feet than upper limb) for the past 3 days. Specialist agreed it could be viral fever as Wbc count start dropping and fever subsiding.  However, liver function test show elevated ast(116 u/l), alp (157 u/l), ldh(1106 u/l). EBV test was negative. 

4th test(5th week): Went back 2 weeks later for review. Wbc is now within normal range except that lymphocyte has dropped but still elevated at 4.3 x 10 9/l. Fever and rash is gone. Doctor is concern that lymphocyte count is dropping slowly. Suggest for me to go for CT scan as my liver function test 2  weeks ago was high and lymphocyte count still slightly elevated. 

Question 1: Thinking back, could the elevated liver function test result on the 3rd week be a result of me taking paracetamol for the past 3 weeks, at an average of 4 pills (500mg each) per day? Plus a combination of infection. 

Question 2: It is highly possible to be lymphoma? However, lymphocyte count and reactive lympocyte have all drop quite a bit, but still slightly elevated. 

Question 3: Possible to be cytomegalovirus or hepatitis virus as i did not do a test on it but understand the symptom to be similar to EBV? Or just some virus that is taking its time to go away which my specialist(and I) hope to be the case.

Thanks

                My recent labs should a lower number of WBC but not out of range just on the low end and a low number of Neutrophils (a little lower than the normal reference range) and high number of lymphocytes (a little higher than reference range). I had a type of non hodgkins lymphoma as a kid and I am 25 now. I am hoping it is just because of my health history they are sending me to oncologist to look into it, should I be worried. what can cause this?

                Okay. I'm 17 and 118lbs. I'm 5'6. I have a couple swollen lymph nodes that are all hard and painless. Some are firm. I have two right under my jaw that are very close. Both are hard and have been present for awhile. During the summer I found a small pea sized lymph node in my armpit/side of breast. I just felt for it and it grew to the size of a nickel or even a quarter. It's hard and fixed and painless. Other symptoms im having is frequent bruising (very easily also), shortness of breath, dizziness, fainting when standing, some weird body aches that last for seconds, loss of appetite, frequent infections, fever of 99.1-100.8 for the last couple days. I can't think of anything else right now. Reminder. I have already went to the doctor and they put me on antibiotics and they said it should make the lymph nodes go down. Well the one on my neck has been present for months, the other on my neck appeared at a different time and it has been present for a month I believe, and the one on my armpit/boob has been present since the ending of summer. So please quickly let me know. I'm scared.

                I am currently suffering from some severe neck pain--constant (severe defined as never been this painful before).  Currently on the back of my skull, on the lower left side, there is a lot of pain and extreme tenderness to the touch.  It also feels enlarged, and when compared to the right side--it does feel larger.  However, there is pain on the right side as well.  I've had a headache since the pain began yesterday morning.  It's painful to even hold my head up, and it's difficult to find a comfortable resting spot.  On the right side of my neck, I can feel a very hard notch (assuming it's a lymph node).

Also, you should be aware that two days ago I had swelling and redness underneath my left eye.  The next day, the upper eyelid was also swollen.  I took some antibiotic eye drops, and for the most part the swelling has cleared.  

If you could please tell me whether the pain on my lower skull is something I should be seen for, I would appreciate it.  I am debating on driving to the ER today, since my doctor's office is not open but didn't want to pay the extra money if it's something I can wait until tomorrow for.

                I'm a 26 year old female in generally good health. For the last 15 years, I've had a tiny lymph node buried deep behind my ear. When I was younger it was larger/palpable; since then it's shrunken in size and doctors usually can't find it by touch (though I still can). It's actually very painful to put any pressure on it, sending shooting pains through my head so that I have to stop immediately. However it's not painful otherwise so doctors have always told me to ignore it. (One said it was probably a fibrotic lymph node pushing on a nerve, but I could just ignore it). 

I always had a bad feeling about this and now in the last months, a large >2cm mass grew up right next to it! I had a sonogram which shows the larger mass but not the small one. The new larger mass was biopsied and though technically a ""benign"" tumor, still recommended for removal. But I'm worried about them touching the very painful adjacent area when operating & causing nerve damage / and or it being an unbearably painful procedure?! I don't know if these concerns are totally silly but any advice would be really appreciated.

                I've had a swollen lymph node under my left jaw for nearly two years, as originally pointed out to me by my dentist, then confirmed by another dentist, a speech therapist, and a GP. This lymph node doesn't hurt, but I finally mentioned it to my ENT, whom I'm seeing for trouble swallowing for the past two years. He determined that my difficulty with swallowing was due to nerve damage on the right side of my throat, but a neck CT scan a year ago turned up no tumor or suspicious lesion in my neck (and no lymphadenopathy, I believe). I asked him about the swelling under my left jaw that was noticed by different healthcare professionals, and he begrudgingly ordered a neck MRI with contrast (gadolinium).

The results came back stating, ""There is evidence for reactive adenopathy but no submandibular mass identified."" [My ENT thought the swelling under my left jaw might've been a mass so he ordered the MRI for the reason ""left submandibular mass?""]. The results continued, ""Bilateral level 2 and left level 1B nodes are identified. Discrete mass is not identified within the submandibular glands. Floor of mouth is normal. Parotid glands are symmetric.""

Should I be at all concerned? I've been sick for awhile (2yrs) with extreme fatigue, swollen joints, essential tremor favoring my left arm, occasional night sweats, general feeling of malaise, bad headaches, inability to concentrate, brain fog, muscle weakness, dizziness, and ventricular tachycardia, mostly attributed to subclinical hypothyroidism, yet my symptoms haven't gone away despite thyroid hormone treatment and normal TSH levels, so I think something else is going on...I'm just not sure what. My neck doesn't hurt and I have no pain under my jaw, either.

Any thoughts would be greatly appreciated!

2cm hypoechoic vascular structure in the region of the lump. No definite fatty hilum is seen. the typical single stalk of vascularity is not definitely identified on these images.

The vascular mass in the region of palpable finding could represent a benign lymph node although the typical fatty hilum and single stalk of vascularity and benign lymph nodes is not definitely seen on todays study.

                I am a 37 yrs old male. And for as long as i remember, i bruise easily, but i dont bruise for no reason. 
When i bruise, but is will be for a certain bump or something. but never bruised for no reason.
i have no nose bleed, or pupura, slight gum bleeding at times when brushing (not always - but once in a while).

I was a smoker and quit smoking 23 days ago.



I have had depression for the last month, and as well i have quit smoking been almost a month now. 
Did some blood tests today. 

My RBC came out 5.6 
Hemoglobin 17.1 
Hematocrit 48 
WBC 5.38 
Platelets 100 


The doc said is the platelets that cause the bruising, he asked for some more tests, as in ABG, LDH,PTT,BLEED TIME, abdomen echo, and CXR. 
Bleed time 2 mins 
The abdomenal echo (spleen normal , liver, kidney, pancreas...all normal) and chest x ray were good. 

My Blood smear said the following: 

RBC: Normocytic normochromic. 

WBC: few atypical lymphocytes seen. 

PLT: Thrombocytopenia with abnormal distribution. 

Activated Partial Thromboplastin time 38 sec

Bleeding Time (Ivy) 2 mins

The doctor advised me to donate a unit of blood = 0.45 L blood. 
And my high hemoglobin was due to my diet, and living in high altitudes and smoking (which i quit about month ago). at the age of 15, i had to dnate blood as i had a very high count of RBC.

He indicated that due to smoking that CO2 level is high in my blood, and yet it has been compensated by a certain base .

But needs to monitor the platelet level, at 100 is nothing to worry about but need to watch it. 

Reading about platelets levels that they should be between 150 and 450...above 450 and below 70 are dangerous. 

I asked the lab doc and my doctor, and my blood doctor since i read a lot about platelets, and LEUKIMEA came up! they said there is non. 

should i worry about LEUKIMEA?

                Hi
Just looking for some advice as I'm really scared at the moment.  For almost 3 months I've had swollen glands and nodes on one side if my neck. It started with the sensation of a lump in my throat (globus hystericus). I've also had many other symptoms, some which have subsided, ie heart palpatations and light tickly cough. At the moment i feel very dizzy and lightheaded,  I have a headache, that moves around for a few days, and nerve pain in my arm, elbow, chest and shoulder. Again this moves between both right and left side. I also have an odd nerve pain in my leg now and again. I have had a full set of blood tests done including total blood count, thyroid test, monospot test for EBV and all have come back normal.  I've also had a CT scan of my abdomen (not sure why abdomen, think it was to check if I had more swollen nodes or enlargement of spleen)and an ECG and all have been normal.
Now,  I'm really scared that I have lymphoma or something serious. I've been told the monospot test for EBV can often give a false negative result but I'm still really worried. Any suggestions or advice? I am going for an MRI of my head and chest next week.

                Good afternoon everyone:

34 year old male - non-smoker - hardly ever drinks - no family history of lymphoma 

OK so here's the story. A little over a week ago I came down with a sore throat. A significantly sore throat. My tonsils, tounge base and back of my throat were all sore but at different times in different areas of the throat. (it seemed to hop around a little but focused on my tonsils) Went to my GP who did a strep test but decided that most likely it was a virus due to several viruses going around. Strep test came back negative 5 days later. I was given ""magic mouthwash"", I tried chloraseptic, halls...etc but nothing was able to reach the part of my throat that was hurting. It got to the point that I went to the ER to get my throat checked out. They gave me a shot of steroids and suggested that I start on antibiotics incase it was strep. (I didn't have my results yet) I had also started on biaxin that I had left over in my house...stopped that and then started on antibiotics they gave me. I stopped them once the results came back negative. The steroids totally took away any pain I had but after a couple days it wore off and the pain returned. Here are my symptoms currently:
Pain on right side of throat - feels sort of bruised as opposed to the cutting pain I normally have when i get a sore throat
Feels like the roof of my mouth is bruised
Right ear hurts and there is a feeling of pressure there as well
Still a red throat with a few sores
Dizzy dizzy dizzy
I've been waking up with portions of my pillow wet...I assume this qualifies as night sweats
5 months ago I went to an allergist due to intense itching all over my body and started on xzyal. As long as I take the xzyzal the itching is kept at bay. I had a bout of itching all over my body about 11 years ago and took allergy medicine for a couple years, stopped and the itching wasn't there anymore. It just recently came back.
3 years ago I was seen by an ENT because i noticed a weird mass on my right tonsil. He took a look at it and agreed that it should be looked at. I was given a CT scan of my neck with contrast that showed everything to be normal with the exception of a thyroid adenoma which was later confirmed with an ultrasound..

My concern is lymphoma or tonsil cancer and i'm trying to keep my OCD/worry wart nature at bay. Any comments would be appreciated. Does this sound like a normal virus or should I have this investigated further?

                Hello :)
I'm hoping to find opinions on my CBC. A brief history. I have been having odd symptoms for years now. I recently tested positive for Chonic Lyme and started treatment in May. Since I started treatment my CBC have been all over the place. My blood is tested every month to make sure the meds are not affecting my liver of kidneys. My WBC count has been constantly high since treatment started. 

My PCP called the other day a referred me to a Hematologist. Everything I look up on the web points to Leukemia. I find it odd that the CBC was relatively normal before treatment. I know I can't have an infection (other than Lyme) I'm currently taking 3750mg of antibiotics per day. I don't think a virus would last this long. The only other thing I can think of is, the meds are triggering my immune system to fight the Lyme and co-infections. 

Is it possible for inflammation to elevate the WBC? I going for testing to see if I have Candida in my GI tract, even though I take 50 billion probiotics a day. 

My latest CBC is: 
WBC 13.48 High
Hemaglobin 15.8 High
Hematocrit 46.6 High
Leutrophils 25.3 Low
Immature Granulocytes .80 High
Neutrophil No. 8.38 High
Immature Granulocytes No. .11 High

So far, these numbers are the best they have been.
Please let know what you think:)
Thank you in advance.

                Male, 45 years old, 40 years old when problems began.

Just before Christmas 2009, I went to the doctor with aching groin and armpits. On examining my groin, the doctor felt a very painful swelling which seemed to be a lymph node. I also had pain radiating down to my testicles, and the doctor diagnosed 'epididymitis', and gave me two courses of antbiotics. I also had an ultrasound on the area which I was told had no abnormalities. After a couple of months, the pains seemed to go away.

Just after Christmas 2013, I felt a pain in my left groin again. Only very slight, but eventually I started feeling it also in the right groin, and went to the doctor in March. I was also suffering abdominal pain and was having problem with stools. The doctor said that my groin lymph nodes were swollen, but not in a way that suggested malignancy. As my abdominal pains were quite bad, he eventually suggested a colonoscopy and a CT scan of abdomen and pelvis. Both seemed to come back normal. IBS was diagnosed, but I have had no constipation or dihorrea, just very thin stool with some blood, so I have little faith in this. Some hemarrhoids (sp?) were found in the colonoscopy and were given as the reason for the blood. 

The aching in my groin has never gone away and I have been back to the doctor several times. I have had 4 blood tests. One showed 'low lymphocytes', but the doctor said he was not concerned. Another was for HIV and other STDs, all of which were negative. My most recent test was in July and the doctor *promised* to call me back if there was a problem, I received no call so assumed it was okay.

Over the last 3 or 4 weeks, I have been feeling very unwell. Drenching nightsweats, a sore throat and mucus at the back of my throat that will not go away (to be honest, Ive had this since Christmas, which was one of the triggers of my doctor trying an HIV test, but it has become noticeably worse in the last month or two), abdominal pain. Worst of all the aching in my groins is non stop, particularly the left. I also feel very, very tired.

The last time my doctor saw me, in July, he said my lymph nodes had gone down, as seen by my CT scan and his own examination, but they feel swollen again to me now. Also, I am having 10 second bursts of burning pain in my armpits every hour or so - not both armpits at same time, separate.

Just to make things worse, the consultant who did the CT scan - who was a gastroenterologist, because of my abdominal pains - wants me back in for an ultrasound. Apparently, they found an 'insignificant' nodule on my spleen, which was assumed to be benign, but another radiologist wants to check it again to be sure.

I went back to my own doctor to ask about this - he is on holiday, but I found out from the receptionist that my July blood test, the one where the doctor promised to call me if there was a problem, was 'slightly out of range'. I asked what this meant, the receptionist said she was not a doctor and I would have to wait for his return from holiday, which I think is this week.

I am now worried sick. The drenching nightsweats and the fact that these pains come in areas where there are lymphnodes, is making me worry seriously about a low-grade Non Hodgkins Lymphoma. My doctor is not in the least concerned about this because a) I had lymph node pain 5 years ago and it went away and b) a lymphoma would show up on bloods and CT scan. However, I have since found out that lymphoma will not necessarily show up in these tests, and the only way to know for sure is a node biopsy.

Please can anybody help with advice on this? My doctor is back this week, and I am so angry that he did not phone me back with the July test results, and I am starting to disbelieve his assurances that I do not have lymphoma.

                Hello all. I know this is a lot of text to go through but I am doing my best to provide a good understanding of my situation. I will appreciate all inputs/suggestions. 

I felt a swollen lymph node around 20th June this year. I showed it to my general physician on 28th June and he confirmed it is a swollen cervical lymph node one the left of my neck. But by feeling it he didn't show any signs of concerns and told me it seems normal. He then suggested an ultrasound by a radiologist. But still said its fine. 

The radiologist told me that just one swollen lymph node has no significance at the same time she said that when a lymph node is swollen that means there is something unusual. ME= SUPER CONFUSED. This happened in the first week of July. 

My GP referred me to referred me to an ENT specialist and I had an appointment on the 28th of July. The ENT's assistant tried feeling lymph other lymph nodes in the jaw, throat, back of the head, arm pits but there weren't any. After that the ENT asked me whether I was ever exposed to TB. He then inserted something into my nostril  I wired camera I guess for further examination) but he said everything was fine and nothing to worry about. 

I was also asked about my family's cancer history and have I ever been treated for HIV/HPV. My answer to that was no! I have never had any sexual relationship (no sexual intercourse). However in the month of April I was with my friend we deep kissed and she performed unprotected oral on me. But that doesn't cause any of those. A NEGATIVE Rapid test got rid of that anxiety for me. 

So my major concern is the ONE PERSISTENT SWOLLEN SERVICAL lymph node which I till today can feel and it is very palpable. Now I feel something in my elbow too. They are INVISIBLE AND CAN ONLY BE NOTICED WHEN TOUCHED. No pain and tender to feel. I'm not sure but I can feel the one in the elbow getting smaller but the posterior cervical node is harder when I wake up in the morning and seems tender throughout the day. What can it be? This anxiety is killing me and is affecting my everyday productivity. Can this be any sign of cancer? No other symptoms - no weight loss, no night sweats etc.

                My husband noticed a small soft mass that feels fatty to me under his right collarbone. It is not attached to anything and moves freely. It is not sore and to me does not feel like a lymph node (??). We are both taking martial arts classes in Krav Maga and it is possible he could have been hit in this area. Does anyone know if trama could cause this or does this sound indicative to cancer?

                Hi, I have a question about some bloodwork my one year old recently had done. She is 14 months old and overall in great health...never really been sick, normal growth/development, etc. I noticed she had a slightly swollen lymph node on one side of her neck (maybe the size of a kidney bean) and took her to her dr who said most likely nothing but wanted to do a blood draw to be safe. He said a couple things were a little outside normal range, but wasn't too concerned and wanted to repeat blood in one month. The NRBC # isn't 0, which everything says is cancer or something else equally terrifying. She has no symptoms other than the slightly swollen lymph node. I don't want to jump to worst case scenario, but obviously can't help but panic thinking about my baby being sick. Any insight would be great.

                Hi

I have a swollen lymph on the left of my neck and was sent for ultrasound (on my whole neck area) and to see a haematologist to check for lymphoma and thankfully everything came back clear.  They think it could be a localised infection or just has always been like it :-)

During the same time another dr noticed that my right tonsil is swollen (just the right one) and did a swab test which came back negative for any infection, now one dr has said he thinks its a viral infection but another (can never see the same dr twice at our surgery!) has said that they want to send me to an ENT to check what's causing this to ensure it's not cancer. 

My referral is weeks away and I wondered if I was already given the all clear for lymphoma, as the tonsils are part of the lymphatic systems, it's not possible for this to be anything sinister which is what they seem to be checking for?

I have had a sore throat and painful neck for a few weeks but no fever etc

My anxiety is pretty high at the minute so any reassurance/advice would be much appreciated. 

Thanks so much

Knee pain is new but the left under rib pain started over 2 years ago. She did some feeling around and said nothing really felt out of sorts but isn't the spleen under the rib cage so how would she feel that anyway? Another WBC was done and this time WBC is up to 11.3 and NEUT is up to 8.4. All others are normal other than borderline low LY count. Doc said that sometimes these are signs for Leukemia but she doesn't think that's what is going on, says its just an infection of some sort even though im not at all sick, but still sending me for a sono of left abdomen on Monday and wanting to recheck blood in a month so obviously there is more going on than what she is telling me. Im losing my mind! Im 41, non smoker, don't drink, is this really happening? I have three small children and im terrified beyond words......im literally sick with fear.

Ok, if you're a doctor prepare to be baffled, i have seen this on multiple forums but no help was provided there....
So here is the problem. In 2012 i got tested negative for lymphoma and the doctor said it would eventually go away....heh.... So it freaking spreads over the next year....ALL OVER MY NECK and i actually had not noticed until an oncologist had felt it when i got tested for another tumor on my leg which turned out to just be a cyst.... she said that if they persist then contact me. So by this time i start to get nervous because i have had swollen lymph nodes from the back of my head to my chin. When i talk to the oncologist again she says that they have not grown at all and that they are probably scarred and will last for the rest of my whole damn life.....What....the....****....now i think i have solved the problem but i want these things OUT OF MY HEAD. They tend to hurt randomly and when i mean hurt i mean like someone was taking tweezers to your head and holding down as hard as they could. 

Now what i really want an explanation on is if they are not cancerous how the hell are they spreading like it, with absolutely no symptoms....?

                I have a lymph node biopsy coming up and I am wondering, will any node in your body show lymphoma? 

I have had lymph node swelling from my ears to my waist for eight months but only on my right side. It varies in severity from day to day and isn't always in the same spots. I've also had a sharp pain around/under my ribs on the right side as well. A tumor was found on the left lobe of my thyroid and despite its removal, my symptoms continue. 

Pathology says Papillary thyroid cancer BUT, it makes no sense that the cancer was on the left, and the lymph swelling is on the right. Both the surgeon and the endocrinologist agree it is unlikely it would spread to the opposite side first. Lymphoma makes much more sense and fits all of the symptoms. One lymph node that was attached to my thyroid was removed but so far, the preliminary path report shows no lymphoma. They will biopsy a couple more nodes while I am under, having the other half of my thyroid removed but, I can't seem to find any information so I am asking you all...would lymphoma show in every node?

Thank you!!! :)

I would greatly appreciate any advice.  For the past 4 months, I have had swollen lymph nodes in my groin (that come and go) and two small ones in my neck (that remain constant, do not get bigger or smaller).  I finally went to the doctor last week and she ran some blood work, including EBV and CMV.  She called me back to say that they all came back normal, and because I've had the swollen nodes for so long with no infection, she was referring me to a hematologist.  I saw the hematologist a few days later and he could barely feel the swollen nodes but since my doctor had, he wanted to do a full body CT scan and more blood work.  He called me the next day to say that my monospot came back positive and to cancel my CTs, that I have mono.  My question is, how can I have mono if my EBV & CMV were negative?  I am reading now about false positive monospots due to lymphoma and leukemia and I am freaking out. I believe he said my leukocytes(?) were slightly elevated as well.

                Advice on a next step? I'm 23 and female, and I have what started as mild, lower right-sided back pain, and has now also progressed to my right side, feeling like it's under my ribs. On occasion, I'll also have like a poking feeling in my mid-right abdomen. Mostly now the pain is felt in my right side in the lower rib area. 

I've already had some blood tests to check liver function, as well as ultra sounds of my bladder, uterus, and right kidney. The doctor poked me to check for gallbladder, I've been going to a chiropractor for 2 months and have also stopped eating gluten. Although these last two steps have helped other things, this side pain remains, and I still have no answers.

About 2 months ago, I also found a moveable, swollen lymph node beneath my right armpit. I got it checked by a surgeon, who said to watch it but that he wasn't worried. Honestly, though, I'm concerned since these things have been going on for so long. All are low grade, but I'm beginning to worry I have lymphoma or a tumor or something going on in my right side. Is that just being paranoid?

Any thoughts? Should I request a scan (like CT or MRI) of my right side? My general doc didn't think I needed one just yet, but I'm getting tired of just waiting. Thanks!

It would go away from time to time but it came back more persistently in June. So I went to my doc, he found a slightly swollen lymph node and ordered me some antibiotics (which I have finished taking) and celebrex (still taking). The pain has now changed, it feels more localized in my armpit now instead of upper chest above left breast. It is a radiating pain I feel when I have my arm in front of me like when I sit at my computer or drive. I have done minimal working out because I worried it would stress it out too much and apply heat presses occasionally. My Uncle just was diagnosed with cancer and two of my grandparents died of it so I am having a melt down about it. I am scared and do not know what to think.

                I first noticed a swollen node on my neck. Then a couple of weeks later, my armpit nodes became swollen and painful. Other nodes in my neck area also became swollen. Then my groin ones also became a bit swollen and a bit painful. The armpit ones are the most painful. The pain gradually seems to be going away but now I am thinking its just waxing and waning. I would need to give it even more time to see if its really going away but the waiting time is making me sick. 

Blood test was normal and ultrasound of node was also normal. 

They keep saying its infection but they cant tell me exactly what infection. Also infections dont last this long do they?

So I am led to believe this has to be lymphoma. There is no other possibility other than cancer of some sort if not another serious illness. It cannot be something minor if its persisting for so long?

am I right to be thinking this?

                Hello all, 

On June 13, I had really bad neck pain. The next day i woke up with a swollen lymph node on the right side of my neck. Now its July 14 and the original lymph node is there with two more on the same side, one right beside it and one behind my ear, one on the left side of my neck, pains around that area from time to time,sometimes a painful swallowing, muscle and joint pains in my hands and knees. Ear aches all the time, some jaw pain on the right and I am a hypochondriac.

I'm confused because everything I have read says its HIV yet I have had the same partner for a year, I have tested negative in February, and he tested negative in April. 

I am getting married soon, and this has been entirely stressful for me.

                So this started a week ago, I woke up with a swollen lymph node about a centimeter and a half in width and an extremely itchy neck about 3 inches below. Before that event occurred my upper back has itched tremendously. Then the itching stopped for 5 days or so and now I just woke up again to this terrible itch on my neck and that won't go away. I read these are signs of hodegikens disease but unsure.

                To make this short, I have been having discomfert in my spleen area for two weeks now and I have hiccups which pretty much confirms its the spleen, however at my appointment last week my doctor did an abdominal examination and these where her words ""i Can feel your spleen"" < ""BUt its not swollen"" so if this isnt my spleen then what is it??? IT feels like a fullness under my left rib toward my back . She knew i was panicking because I kept asking her for reassurance ""Its not swollen is it"" ""IS it normal sized"" and she said nothing is wrong with it so idk:(, Im so scared I have leukemia I dont know what to do I have an appointment next week im so scared. I just dont feel myself and i cant eat anything unless its at night.

                I had an ultrasound of my enlarged submandibular lymph node, and I was wondering if they normally look at the thyroid as well.  My lymph node is about an inch and three quarters, and is non tender.  My CBC came back normal.  I have not gotten the results of my ultrasound yet.  But I do know that they did ultrasound my thyroid and pretty much my whole neck on both sides.  I don't know if she saw something when she was looking at my lymph node to warrant looking at the thyroid and other structures in the neck, or if it just the standard to look at everything.

                This is long, it is also posted in undiagnosed symptoms. I'm posting here as well because some of the symptoms seem to fit those of blood cancers, but because blood work was normal I'm just not sure... thanks for any advice you can offer.

Need advice please. Rash on trunk with concentration on stomach and breasts (rash was pink/red and hurt when clothes touched it, not pimply and not in a band or just one side of body) and sudden joint pain beginning 6/8. Went to urgent care on 6/12 because rash was worse and so fatigued I was having a hard time functioning. Normal blood work. IV to hydrate me, motrin for pain-dx'd as viral exanthem. Rash, fatigue, migratory joint pain continued. Went back to urgent care on 6/19; still had rash, vague joint pain, but both sides of neck hurt so bad from jaw to collar bone that I'd been sleeping with heating pad on neck for two nights--still very fatigued. Dr was dismissive, did do blood work though (all normal, mono spot negative, strep culture negative). Sent me with 5 days of prednisone and told me urgent care is for life threatening emergencies, not diagnostics. Started prednisone on 20th in a.m., had worst back pain of my life late that evening. Almost went to e.r. but took 4 motrin and went to bed with heating pad. 6/21 I was still having bad back pain moving into hips/glutes; sides of neck slightly tender but not bad. 6/22 sides of neck hurt again. Feel like glands under jaw are swollen. Definitely have swollen lymph nodes on right side of neck, not huge, but palpable when they never had been before. Also have one that is palpable in collar bone hollow on left side. 6/24, rash is flaking now (prednisone worked?). 6/25, skin pain so bad I can't have sheet on me, it hurts to sit/lay, etc. 6/26 body aches and skin pain, still have swollen lymph nodes, woke up drenched. 
I stopped making calendar entries on the 26th because it was pointless. Whatever this is doesn't want to go away. Im tired, have nightly sweats that wake me shivering and I have to change, I've lost 13 lbs in 4 weeks, for the last week my right inner thigh/groin hurts when I'm sitting or laying down and the ball of my right foot hurts at rest and when I walk. Also have mild pain at bottom of ribs on both sides and aching under armpits. Have not had a high fever that I know of, it's been running 99.5-100 in afternoons/evenings. Very fatigued still, still having joint pain but not as severe as first couple weeks. Neck is tender on side still tonight. Any ideas? I have no insurance and am not immersed in having a doctor be dismissive with me again and then pay a $1500 bill. On the other hand if it could be serious, I don't want to wait too long. Would a viral exanthem, as the first doc said, last this long? When will it go away? 
No clue if it's related, but one week before the initial onset, I had a headache that started like someone driving an ice pick in my head for about 2 seconds at a time every 5-10 minutes for about three hours. This stopped and later that night I woke up with a headache so severe I was bawling. I took two aspirin and 2 motrin and then drank a bottle of water. I was home from work on the couch the entire next day sleeping. Felt great the following days until the rash/joint pain began. 
I normally have a couple cold each year and might miss two days of work every 12 months. I've never been sick like this before.

                I am curious to know how others keep themselves from getting tunnel vision regarding CLL.  When I first got the diagnosis I was fine with it... for about 15 hours then it got to me, in a big way.  I am so tired and my glands are so swollen that I cannot swallow or sit up comfortably as it hurts the swollen glands in the groin area, it affects my pain condition causing even more inflammation. The lymph nodes that are swollen are in 3 different places, neck, underarm, groin. I lost my appetite about a month ago and cannot sleep well even though I am exhausted. Also, my sensitivity to our usual household products and foods has really gotten exaggerated.  My husband showers at the opposite end of the house (leaves door closed when done too) and I still get nauseous from the smell of the shampoo. We had a bacon, egg and hash-brown omelet 3 days ago and I can still smell the cooking smells from that.  About a year ago our normal household products have become irritating and unusable, causing headaches, nausea and irritating the mucous membranes in my mouth, nose and eyes. Like a 'super-chemical' stalking me.

I have very serious night sweats where I have to change my gown and since I cannot stay up long enough to change sheets I lay down a bath sheet every 4-5 hours which starts about an hour before my normal bedtime.  I would sure like to lie in dry sheets again adn not up top of wet or towels, it's been so long I forgot what dry bedding feels like.  I experience severe dizziness and have been falling after a couple steps, too weak to take another step, my husband had to fetch my wheelchair and bring it to me in the middle of the night as I got too weak and could not finish my daily walking (about 40 steps is all I can do without assistance other than furniture or walls).  I have been extremely nauseous many times in the last 6 months and now, more times than the previous 10 years combined.  The nosebleeds don't want to stop once they start and are rather nasty to deal with. My eyesight is affected and I have a few blind spots in certain directions and then my eyes water profusely all the time. And it seems like my muscles cannot move fluidly like before and a lot of involuntary twitches, some are pretty pronounced and obvious.

How do you deal with the weakness and resulting feelings of worthlessness and dread coupled with the pain I've been dealing with for the last 14 years after a crushing accident.  I have tried getting it off my mind but it is ever-present and quite a nuisance.

                I have been feeling extremely unwell for over 9 months now -  have gone to my PC several times and now am seeing a GI and  Neurologist. I am nauseous most of the time, have pain in both right and left quadrants of my upper abdomen, have lost, unintentionally, about 35 pounds now. I also have night sweats and trouble sleeping. I am post-menopausal so the sweats cannot be hormone related. I also have diabetes and HBP. My 'normal' temperature is usually around 97 but lately has been going up around what's considered 'normal' for others or even a bit higher. I also feel alternating 'hot and sweating' one minute and 'chilling' the next. At night I feel chilly so cover with my blanket and then a minute or more later I have to throw the covers off! My pillow, clothes and sheets, etc, are so drenched I have to get towels and wrap them around me and change them sometimes more than once.

Now, on my CBC & Diff lab results, my LYMPH is 19.2 and my NEUTROPHIL is 8. I also have discovered a 'baseball-size' lump under my left armpit - I really have no idea how long it has been there but it couldn't have been long - I had noticed that my underarm seemed (to me) 'fatter' than it had ever been. (LOL) I have had my PC examine it and was told it is probably a lipoma. However, it seemed very firm to me (not rubbery, or like bread dough) and my left arm is now feeling tingly all the way to my fingertips. I am so exhausted all the time, I can hardly do anything anymore.

I had a CT scan of my abdomen today and will have a MRI brain scan tomorrow (there is a possibility I have been experiencing TIA's - I am having trouble 'finding' words and even speaking out the one I'm intending to say and balance problems - I walk like I'm drunk!) and a endoscopy/colonoscopy on Friday. (I have also had chronic diarrhea for over 9 months also.)

I just turned 64, but I have always been considered at least 20 years younger than I am - until now.

I know I have several things going on - but am hoping someone may have experienced something similar and may be able to help give me some insight.

                Hi everyone I'm a 19 year old female and I've recently suffered from health anxiety which I got diagnosed with In late March by gp
I convinced myself I had breast cancer, cervical cancer then heart disease. In around June I started to feel a lot better and stopped taking my tablets now I'll get on to the main bit... About 3 month ago maybe longer or less I noticed some lumps in my armpit which I obviously was concerned about it feels like there's about 2 or 3 they aren't solid but are quite firm and movable and it's hard to tell how big they are. I totally forgot about them until one day I searched in Google ""common cancers"" and lymphoma came up so I looked up symptoms and then when it says lump in armpit It came back to me that I had a lump in armpit. So I started to feel it again. It hasnt got any bigger etc. Also I have had a cold and also a bladder infection within the past 2-3 month which obviously 
Was gone in a week. I'm very convinced I have lymphoma I just sit and cry and want to be ok I'm to scared to go to my gp as I'd rather not find out. I don't have any other symptoms at all like weight loss, fatigue, etc. There's no lumps in other parts of my body. There's no cancer at all in any of my family. Also when my arm is raised high they can't be felt it's just when my arm is relaxed and I lift the same side hand up and when I feel with other side it can hardly be felt either. Also last week I had a couple of drinks with friend and nothing happened I didn't have any pain. Some of it might not make sense but just need answers asap!! I know not really anyone on here is medically trained but just need some answers from people's experience of lymphoma what did there lump feel like? Should I be very worried? Did people get symptoms or not? Thanks you

                Hi,just to review: 3cm inguinal node, not reactive, loss of hilum, needle biopsy showed no metestatic cells, now waiting for consult with surgeon for full biopsy. I had another scan of the node last week and VERBALLY, it didn't sound so good. I asked her if it still looked suspicious? Yes. Did it still show same characteristics? Yes. The largest node has only grown a tiny bit, but it still concerned her. She was very surprised that this was not being done in a more timely matter. She said the node needs to be taken out and we really need to see what is in there.The report itself is very simple. It states that it is noted AGAIN that there are multiple enlarged nodes, and that several of these have lost the normal architecture detail. However there has been no DRAMATIC increase in numbers or size since the last study. So I ask again: am I in the right forum?

                Hello all! I was not 100% sure where to post this question, so I figured I would bring it here since it is relevant. I had a blood profile done because it was free through work. I am a 28yo male and I do have a high BP past and currently take lisinopril/hctz. Other than that, I am typically in excellent health. 

I do have a doctors appointment scheduled, but with the holiday it will be next week. So I guess you could say worry is getting the best of me.

Basophil Abs, Auto 0.04 (0.00 - 0.10 normal)

This may be too complex to answer on here about what these results could mean, just looking for some insight. Obviously my own doctor will have his own opinion and may do further tests. I will say that at the time of this test I still had a pretty severe cold lingering, my tongue/throat were swollen approximately 5-7 days prior to the test and I still had a sore throat/cough at testing. I am not sure if those can play with my numbers that much or not. Thanks for your time and answers.

                Hello everyone, my name is Steve. I'm 26 years old. I have a Black Lab female named Zoey. She is my everything. Been with me through thick and thin. She will be 8 years old this September. Here's whats happening. Wednesday morning I woke up and she had peed on the carpet with some blood in it. She has had a UTI before so I figured okay we go to the vet and get the antibiotics. Later in the day when the vet was able to get us in I was smacked with the ""she may have lymphoma.""  WHAT?!? 

Yea not what I was expecting. They took a pee sample and also did an X-ray, due to Dr. Rice thinking maybe a kidney stone. The pee sample showed abnormal white blood cell count and the X-ray showed two lymph nodes were swollen. So he sent us home with two prescriptions of cloromax with saying he really thinks it's lymphoma but hopes the best. He later called me to tell me the appt for the specialist to take an ultrasound is on Tuesday. 

So Tuesday is the day I will know for sure. I have done all the research and know whats in store if it is truly lymphoma. I've been watching her pee every time and she isn't peeing blood anymore since on the antibiotics. Now I know antibiotics won't do anything to cancer so could there be something else going on than lymphoma? If so, what? Maybe two different things? Also just because she isn't peeing any anymore, does that mean what I think? That the antibiotics are doing something?  

Thank you for any reply.

                Hello,

I have always suffered from health anxiety and about a month ago I grew a small lump on the left side of my neck. I was told that it was a lymph node but it seems odd it hasn't disappeared for a month now. 

It is sometimes sore but generally there is no pain, no fatigue and I am generally healthy. Currently, a pimple is growing right on the lump as well so I am wondering if that has to do with anything.

I do have acne so bacteria there is a possibility, plus allergies have been bad this year.

I had it checked and was told by a doctor not to worry and it was harmless, however I am still worried. Could this develop into something if it doesn't go down, and why has it stayed there for so long?

                I have relatively bad acne on my back, however 2 months ago I noticed a large lump on my neck not far away from my right ear. It was painless and unlike the regular pimples I get. It's not rock hard, but not soft either. There is also a very small one about a cm away from it.  

I know I shouldn't of, but I googled symptoms anyway and convinced myself I had lymphoma. 

I went to a doctor and he said it was nothing to worry about, told me it was a type of acne  and gave me some antibiotics. 
A month later, it's still there. Hasn't really changed. 

You see, I am a bit of a hypochondriac so I am still worrying about it...I dont get acne on my neck, and it's a bit too suspiciously located for comfort. But I feel embarrassed going to see another doctor about it, knowing I have already been examined by one who thinks it's nothing to worry about. 

What do you think I should do.....

                I found my first swollen lymph node about 6 months or so ago on the back of my neck. Until last summer when I got my tonsils taken out, I usually got strep throat at least twice a year. Knowing my history, my doctor said that it was probably just a lingering lymph node from all of those infections. Six months later (presently) it is still there. It is about the size of a bean and does not hurt. 

About 2 or 3 months ago, I felt a lump on the side of my breast. It is located somewhat in the middle of my armpit and my breast. The bumps/that area sometimes hurts to press on, but I lift weights often and the muscles there are often sore. I went to the school health center about it and she did a breast exam. She didn't really feel anything and said that it is probably just in my muscle and that if symptoms or the lump persists then to come back. I waited about two months and recently went back because the lump is still there. At this point I can feel more than one lump. They are fairly small. Another doctor checked it out and said he didn't think it was anything to worry about but sent me to an ultrasound anyways just to be sure. I got the ultrasound and the results came back completely normal. 

While waiting for the results, I happened to notice another swollen lymph node or small lump in my groin area. I also found two slight visible bigger lumps. As I felt around it seemed that it is a clump of little bumps or swollen lymph nodes. I can't be sure that all of these are swollen lymph nodes, but that is my overall question. Could the lumps in my breast that I'm feeling be lymph nodes? If all of these little bumps are lymph nodes, it can't be good that they are in three different places, correct? What are the possible causes for this? 

I just want to get a little more information before I go back to the doctor because I don't want to go back if it seems like nothing to worry about. I also find myself very tired a lot. The feeling of severe fatigue comes and goes meaning that it is not every week, but some days and weeks are worse than others. As you can see I'm just a little paranoid... finding lumps on your body is not exactly reassuring!

                I know I asked this question in Apr, but no responses.  Just checking back to be sure that NHLymphoma is not a comorbidity with anyone in the HCV thread?  My situation: I was in remission from NHL from tx course last year with Rituxan.  Had pet/ct last month before starting Sov/Olysio and found a suspicious NHL uptake sign on my colon.  A new activity site for me not found on previous scans.  While I am concerned about having a colonoscopy with low WBC and platelets, my hep Dr. said I could schedule it during HCV tx.  Has me caught in the bind of deciding what to do for one serious and life threatening illness that doesn't dangerously compromise the other one.  This bind will dogg me for some years until NHL therapies advance to a cure - not the case now.  Since the NHL was possibly caused by the HCV chronic inflammation and a suppressed immune system, my treatment team (more of a silo) went with treating NHL first and then as soon as possible for HCV. I have known about the HCV for over 10 years and was stable mostly.  I was waiting for new HCV drug approvals.  Then the NHL appeared last year.  Besides now dealing with it, I have advanced to cirrhosis.  Couldn't wait any longer to treat HCV - am happy that off-label combo was approved for me last month.  I will probably go forward with colonoscopy ASAP even with risk since I can't ignore the possibility that cancer is active again.  Anybody have any experience with this?  Do you have a great doctor you are working with fluent in HCV and blood cancer?

Thanks for any responses.

                First off, let me tell you a little about myself: for the past 2-3 years random lymph nodes all over my body (not confined to one spot) small and big randomly hurt. The pain lasts for about 30 seconds and after touching it a bit the pain goes away. The pain isn't excruciating but I'm still quite worried nonetheless. They don't really swell up at all (maybe very little but its hard to tell). They also hurt when I'm at the gym lifting weights. 

From what I understand, in lymphoma, one experiences swelling but no pain. I, however, am experiencing the  exact opposite (pain but no swelling). Some other symptoms I have which may or may not be related is swelling of my tongue, pain in my spleen, and my upper middle abdomen (where the liver is located- not sure if this would help but just throwing it out there). I'm also very skinny and I have always been skinny for all my life so I don't think I experienced the classic weight loss associated with lymphoma either. Nor do I have a fevers or night sweats. So, I'm almost entirely sure that I do not have lymphoma but if this is true, what could I possibly have? If you have any other questions for me that may lead to a diagnosis please don't hesitate to ask. 

By the way, I've been to my general practitioner but he told me that the fact that this has been going on for years means that its probably nothing major... So he told me to just live with it! What kind of a doctor would say that to a patient?? Anyway, please help me out and give me a potential diagnosis so I could I go back to the doctor with some solid information. Thank you so much!

                Ok so quick review...

I had a lump under my jaw area I was concerned about for over a year. It was rock hard and didnt move. It also however never got larger than 1cm.

Recently I had it biopsied and before receiving the results I noticed a few days afterwards that the lump had shrunk to almost nothing. Then I got the results which said it was a reactive lymph node and my ENT said that would explain the shrinking. I had told him that at the time I could still feel a tiny lump but that it was much smaller than it had been and he had said it would probably never fully go away. Within the past few days I was explaining my story to a friend and touching the area at the same time and I think its starting to get bigger again. It doesnt seem as large as it had been and I'm not sure if it still as small as it had shrunken to. I'm not sure if my mind is playing tricks on me in thinking its grown.

So my question is, what exactly is a reactive lymph node? Do they get smaller and then bigger again? If so, I'm a little concerned that mine didnt shrink on its own, that a needle shrunk it, almost as if it was drained. Is there any possible way that cancer would act this way as well.. Shrinking and then enlarging again?? I've been told if it was cancer a biopsy wouldnt have shrunk it no matter what.. Is this true??  I'm so tired of worrying about this that I'm seriously thinking about getting it removed!!! Aahhhh!!!  Please help...

After 2 weeks of this it went away, didn't have swollen lymph nodes and no sore throat anymore. But now a week later after feeling fine my throat started hurting again and I have white patches on my tonsils. Also the same lymph nodes are in pain again. Are my lymph nodes swollen because of the sore throat or do I have something serious (ex. Lymphoma)?

I have recently had a tooth removed and an implant inserted. The was swelling which I thought was from the tooth but the dentist said it was a lymph node as nothing showed up on the xray. He gave me antibiotics for the implant and the node went down, but now that the antibiotics have stopped the node is swollen again and hardish. It is on the right side of my face along the jaw bone and has been swollen again for about 2 weeks.

Does anyone know what could be causing it, and is it something to worry about?

All responses greatly appreciated as I'm getting really stressed out by it!!!!

Hi there,

I have a swelling under my left breast which I believe is an enlarged spleen but I'm not exactly sure. I have had this for years and has never been an issue, though it's never been truly evaluated. It does NOT hurt whatsoever and I don't feel fullness in that part of my abdomen.

Full physical two months ago, CBC all normal apart from very mild high cholesterol. Recently (two weeks ago) I noticed knee pain/mild swelling, so now I'm concerned adding the spleen and knee pain together. How likely??

Also, I recently had an upper endoscopy for my IBS and my doctor also requested a sono/ultrasound for my liver to check on a benign hematoma which is still ok. My question is, would an enlarged spleen have been spotted during the endoscopy or the liver scan?

Finally, if it's not an enlarged spleen, what else could the bulge be?

Many, many thanks in advance.

                Yesterday I finally had the biopsy I had been waiting for for months! I finally found an ENT who took me seriously enough and respected my request to get a biopsy on a lump under my jaw that's hard and doesn't move, but hasn't grown larger than 1cm in over a year. The process itself was annoying at the hospital. I had an IV in my arm almost the entire time because originally my ENT ordered a fine needle biopsy with CT scan guidance but last minute the doctor who was going to perform the biopsy decided to have an ultrasound guided fine needle biopsy instead. The process itself was between 5-10 minutes but the waiting was forever. I was there at 8:30 AM and the biopsy wasn't until 11. I wasn't allowed to be discharged until around 12:30PM. So in the end the IV was for nothing and putting it in and taking it out hurt more than the biopsy itself and it left me with a nice size black & blue. But I'm glad I got it done.

I say all of this to ask about false results such as false negatives or false positives. It hadn't even crossed my mind until I overheard someone talking about it in the hospital yesterday. How often does this occur? Should I be concerned that it may be a possibility. I was told to wait between 24-48 hrs to get the results. I graduate college tomorrow and I don't want bad news before I graduate. Any info on this would be helpful. Thanks.

                Hi; I am a 52 year old female, with an enlarged painless groin node. At first scan, four weeks ago, it was 2.7 cm, and radiologist was concerned and suggested biopsy. Second scan, by same radiologist at six weeks, the node had grown to 3 cm, and she said it was ""suspicious"" looking, and that it was NOT reactive. One week later, I had a needle core biopsy done, because this was deemed ASAP, and the radiologist at the hospital said it was very suspicious, and that it had grown some more, and he said I should  prepare myself for bad news. One week and one developing ulcer later, I called my doctor's office this morning, and was told that they had reviewed the results and everything's great, nothing's wrong, don't be concerned.....well that is wonderful news that the needle core showed no malignancy, but how about WHY DO I HAVE A NODE ON MY THIGH THAT CONTINUES TO SWELL? My doctor considers this normal? I made an appointment to discuss this with her, and I would like to know what I should ask? Should I just accept that I have a group of enlarged nodes and one is over 3cm? If that is normal I will accept that and be grateful for no malignant cells, but having them there makes me nervous. Thank you for your time.

                I have been feeling significantly under the weather for about a month (low grade fevers, night sweats, sore throat, fatigue). I recently moved and had not established primary care doctor so I went to an urgent care facility 5 days ago. They conducted exam and blood panels. They didn't detect strep throat or other infection from exam. My blood work  revealed that my WBC was elevated (12.8), my Absolute Neutrophil level was very high (9523) and my calcium level was high (10.4). I'm very worried and I""m working on getting seen for more testing. All my internet research points to either extreme stress or high probability of cancer (possibly Lymphoma or Leukemia based on blood work). I should also mention that I have a visible swelling on my neck (most pronounced on the left side as a lump). The neck swelling is always there, but seems to be more noticeable some days. Can anyone give me some information on my situation? I'm trying to rule out cancer in my research but it seems to point back to it at ever turn. Sincerly appreciate any input.

                Last week on Wednesday I noticed 3 lymph nodes swollen on my neck. They were all very hard and movable. None of them were bigger than an inch in diameter & all were round. None were painful 

1 was an occipital lymph node. 
1 was a spinal accessory lymph node. 
1 was a tonsillar lymph node. 

I just moved, so i went to a new doctor for a checkup on thursday & mentioned the nodes. 

He had me get my blood taken & urine samples. Besides the testing, he said further action isnt really neccessary because the swelling of the nodes is so new, plus they arent big. 

I expressed to him my concern because of the fact that they were all hard& he referred me to a surgeon for an appt. on Wednesday. 

Anyways today after I got home from a memorial day get together, I noticed 2 more swollen lymph nodes& that my previous tonsillar node grew in size! 
1 is a parotid node. It is about an inch in diameter, doesnt protrude much, but is painful! even without touch! Its hard and wont move like the others >..< 

And I know a lot of people have bigger nodes or have their nodes longer before getting them checked out, but im just so worried. I never have been able to feel my lymph nodes in my life and I have been sick so much! I got sick with strep, swine flu & mono all within 6 months. I mean I usually get sick about 3-7 times a year! 

So to have this sudden onset of swollen lymph nodes, let alone with no other symptoms is pretty worrisome for me. 

Basically I just want to know how worried I should be?

                i Guys, 
This is a complex story, I will try and keep it as simple as I can. 
In brief, I came down ill in April 2012, initially they thought I had M.S or something similar: to date no concrete evidence of any and after a battery of testing nothing conclusive. Nonetheless, excluding the numbness and pin and needles (maybe the possibilty of m.s, at a later date) these are my current symptoms: 

Neck discomfort, not chronic pain but very weak and tender, this started approx 18mths ago and now is every day all day. 

Chronic pain in limbs this was intermittent before lasting a few ago and then went, now for the last 6 months its been chronic everyday all day, but mainly worse a night where its quite unbearable, mainly in right leg and both arms. 

Bones feel tender much more than usual, I cannot have people lean on me and vicer versa, this has been approx 9 mths and by breast bone area and arms seem the most tender, although my legs bones are too, but not as bad. 

I have spontaneous sickness, without any causes at all. Sometimes it has lasted a few weeks but only appears to be the morning when I actually vomit. It goes away, then can happen here and there for a day, and may be sick 1-7 in an hour and I am then as right as rain. I have not been sick now for 7 weeks, but this is quite typical. 

My skin has got really itchy later but much worse after 10pm for some reason, and I itch anywhere and everywhere, although I have itchiness in the day its not so noticeable. 

I'm hot allot at night time, and sweat allot but not to the level of drenching the sheets. Not much in the day. 

I have bruised much easier than normal, every time I have a blood test or a canular in, it leaves me with huge bruises, and very tender. 

I appear dehydrated, I have been placed on saline twice, this was found incidenlty, as I had another minor op (colcoscopy on cervix..no cancer found) . It could be caused by medication though. 

Terribly tired and fatigued since May 2012, sometimes it so bad I fall asleep in the day for 4 hrs, after only being up for 2. then it improves, then it happens again. 

I keep feeling chills, achey, like i'm gonna come down with the flu and then nothing happens? this started 18 mths ago, again was quite sporadic and intermittent, probably last a few hours once in while. Now its everyday a few hours some times more, occasional I wake up badly shaking feverish and then a few hours later it goes. 

Lastly I get tender tonsil every few weeks, i never have throat infection or  tonsillitis, it last a few hrs - couple of days, not really painful, then disappears and comes back a  few later. antibiotics didn't work or diflam (antiseptic numbing throat spray). 

Test 6 blood test over 2 years revealed raised white cell count between 11.2 and 15.3 at the highest and raised neutrophils 9.1 - 11.3 at the highest. 

Head and neck MRI  December 2013 noted ""cervical nodes are noted"" 
The exact same was noted on the next MRI done this April 2013. 

I have a Hematologist app in 6 weeks. I dont know what to expect, my g.p said they may wish to do  a bone marrow. 

So I guess my question is could I have Leukemia or Lymphoma? 
What will the Hematologist do and be looking for? 
What does ""cervical nodes have been noted mean""? 

Many thanks in advance, sorry for the long post

                Hi everyone.

I've posted about this topic before with some concerns and I've done some follow up with other doctors since then as well. Over a year ago, March 2013, I found a hard non movable lump under my jaw. It's about the size of a pea. In October 2013 I suddenly became concerned about it so I went to the doctor. She said she thought it was a lymph node. Went to an ENT and he thought it was a bone. I didn't like getting 2 different answers so I asked for a CT scan. The results pretty much said that I had multiple lymph nodes all in normal size range and no nodal necrosis was found. I didn't like however, that the ENT didn't really go over the results with me and pretty much just sent me on my way and told me not to worry about it.

I found a new ENT who took the time to review my previous results. He agreed to send me for a biopsy per my request however the hospital for whatever reason wanted updated CT scans before I had the biopsy done. So the other day I went for another CT scan and today I went in to review the results. 

It still says that the lymph node in question is still 1 cm which I was told is a good sign. It also says ""although not significantly enlarged, because of its peripheral enhancement and low central density, further assessment with biopsy is highly recommended."" What exactly does this mean? I'm suddenly very worried again. Any information that anyone could give would be very helpful. My biopsy is scheduled for next week and I'm very nervous.

                I have had fatigue, muscle weakness, chills, sweats, weight loss (12# in 5 weeks), swollen lymph nodes in neck, cough, headache, stomach pains, and other lesser symptoms for the past 6 months with no visible infection. Blood work(cbc, sedrate, b12) has all come back normal except high crp. Neck ct shows reactive nodes 6-9 mm in size throughout with more prominent nodes on right side. ENT says it isn't his problem to solve,  Rheumatologist doesn't believe it is autoimmune related. Chest x-ray shows mass larger than a quarter on upper left side. 
We have family history of cancer(breast, ovarian, prostate, lung)
Should I, as recommended, just continue to live with the fatigue and other symptoms and hope that in time it improves or should I seek further tests? What specialty doctor do I seek?

                Hi, 
I've had symptoms for nearly 9 weeks now and getting seriously fed up as it is affecting my daily life. Been to the doctors 3 times and had 3 different blood tests, most recent tests have been normal. Last year, I had an operation to remove my appendix and I had some pain similar to stomach pain I'm having recently but it disappeared last year after a couple of weeks. 
Two doctors have thought it was glandular fever although a test was negative, 
Symptoms include: 
- weakness
- General feeling of being unwell 
- swollen/enlarged tonsils for weeks 
- aching neck and sometimes face 
- itching in armpits 
- general itchy skin - particularly armpits, neck, stomach 
- pain, where I previously had appendix operation on the right, but also on the left
- sometimes pain on left of back 
- occasional bleeding when brushing teeth 
- sometimes have irregular bowel movements 
Any help or advice would be greatly appreciated!

                5 months ago, I had my blood drawn for school. My WBC came back low at 2.6 (normal limit 3.4-10.8), My Neutrophils came back 28L (normal 40-74), Absolute Neutrophils 0.7L (normal 1.4-7.0), Lymphs high at 57 (normal 14-46) Monocytes 12 (normal 4-12). I go back next month for a repeat Xs two with a peripheral smear. They didn't really explain to me what this means and I'm a little worried that it could be cancer.

I've also been having a lot of bone and joint pain, especially in my hips and knees. Recently I have been having a lot of discomfort in my stomach as well as being tired all of the time. I know these are all symptoms of Leukemia and I can't help but freak myself out over this. Can anyone give me some advice on what the likelihood is that I actually do have it?

                Hi I'm not sure if I'm posting to the right discussion group, but my concerns are:

* My red blood cell count has been high in the past year.

January 2013: 5.33 (4.94-4.80)
August 2013: 4.94 (3.80-4.80)

The levels have not been tested again since.

* I was diagnosed Hashimoto's in January of this year but although my antibodies have waxed and waned and I am receiving treatment with Levothyroxine I understand that Hashimoto's is associated with Non-Hodgkins Lymphoma?

* The thyroid ultrasound I had done in February 2012 showed the thyroid had another blood supply and I have been told that this is indicative of cancer/lymphoma. This blood supply has since gone as the repeat ultrasound done in March of this year showed nothing. I'm now under the impression this has now moved. 

* I have since developed pains in my right breast, 2 lumps in the same breast, and dull pains in my back, shoulder blade and ribcage.

* I have had breast problems in the past as I had a blocked milk duct confirmed by biopsy. This was back in 2005.

Any advice would be welcomed.

:)

                My brother is sick for more than a year and no one know what is wrong with him. He is complaining about pain below the collarbone just under the arm cavity, and the glands under his arm is also swollen. He has pain on the right side of his neck, and his face feels dead )right side and an awful funny deathly fatigue came over him).  He will go into a coma and suddenly wake up again.  He is also complaining about painful muscles, feeling confused from time to time, weight loss, sweats and fatigue. He done a couple of blood tests and still no results.  What can be wrong with him? We as family are very concerned about his illness.

                Hello - I'll try to make this quick.  I have stage 2 cirrhosis due to autoimmune hepatitis.  Took azathioprine many years (not now due to side effects) and have history of leukemia in my family.  My blood counts are pretty low.  Lower than they have been.  I feel not well.  I can almost tell when my body is really, really not right - and feel in some ways similar to how I felt when my autoimmune hepatitis was diagnosed.  

The oddest sensation is in my bones.  I don't know how to explain this, but it's as if my bones are ""going to sleep"".  Maybe a tingling or numbness.  I wonder if this is just my bone marrow shutting down.  I have a very demanding job, and often times don't get a lot of sleep.  When I sleep more, I feel better - as if my bones are waking up and full of energy.

I researched aplastic anemia, leukemia, and none of them seem to fit.  Aplastic anemia because my reticulocyte count was normal.  Leukemia because none of my differential WBC counts are high.  Am I just seeing the effects of chronic lack of sleep and pushing too hard?  When I push myself really hard, I can feel my organs begin to ""Swell"" if that makes sense.  Like I feel my liver like a big hockey puck in my side.

The borderline positive ANA test has me concerned.  I've posted all my abnormal values and reference ranges below.    Also, I had a thyroid and lipid panel that came back normal.  

All these issues makes it hard for me to eat.  I am 6 feet tall and weigh around 100lbs.

Do I need to go on disability?  I already work from home, but perhaps I am to a point where I need to let go.  I can't imagine I'll live very much longer.  I am 27.  There are many nights where I wonder if I will even wake up in the morning.  In fact I pray that God will let me out of my body.  That isn't suicidal or me giving up.  It's me wanting to move on.  I'm almost hoping I'll get something that will finally tell me it's OK to stop working, to stop pushing myself so hard.

I'd really appreciate any thoughts that anyone has.

The listing of my abnormal counts are below.

Hemoglobin: 12 (Ref 13.5-17.5)
Hematocrit: 33 (Ref 41-53)
MCH: 35 (Ref 26-34)
Platelets: 126 (Ref 150-450)
Abs Neut: 1.2 (Ref 1.8-7.7)
Abs Lymps: 0.9 (Ref 1-5)
Sodium: 133 (Ref 136-146)
AST: 38 (Ref 15-37)
WBC: 2.6 (Ref 3.8-11)
RBC: 3.4 (Ref 4.5-5.9)
Vitamin D Hydroxy: 19 (Ref 30-80)
ANA: 1:40 Titer, Nucleorar Pattern (Ref, Below 1:40 Titer)
Blood Osmolarity: 274 (Ref 280-305)

Reticulocyte Counts were normal

                It's big and it is painful.  It's at least two nodes.  It does not seem to me to be a hernia.  It's firm but not hard and it's on my right groin area.  A couple of days before I noticed this sudden huge swelling (2 1/2 inches long! by about an inch wide) I noticed a sore spot on my outer labia. It was smaller than a dime and just slightly red and sore.  No new sex partner.  On examining this sore spot, I did not detect a tick, but I wasn't thinking about ticks when I was examining it.  I was thinking about how I had been trying new soaps lately.  One of the soaps had a nut oil in it, and I stopped that because I can react to nuts.  I have been noticing tiny, tiny bumps on my skin that are not itchy.  I figured that was from the soap.  But ticks are active here in NC, and it could be one of those immature ticks that are so tiny.  The ticks I saw here last year early on were Lone Star ticks.  I have not seen a bull's eye.  I feel fine - no fever, almost no hot flashes (at my age, a little is to be expected, but as long as i don't eat soy yogurt it is extremely minor).  I don't feel tired.  I started a second job (outside in the sunshine), on my feet all day, and I'm not tired.  I have been battling a spot of psoriasis all year, but I think that's because the sun refused to shine for so long.  

What does this sound like?  Lymphoma?  Tick bite?  ??  I'd call the doctor but it's Saturday, NATURALLY.  My neck is a little sore, but I think it's from working out.  OH, and I have Celiac disease, but I've been gluten-free for about 3 years, as soon as my surgeon said he was certain I had Celiac and I should get off gluten.

                My son is 24 years old and went in last week for what we thought would be a hernia repair. Instead the surgeon found what he referred to as ""a lot of swollen and necrotic lymph nodes"". He took several specimens and sent them in to be biopsied which came back negative. My son has also told me that he occasionally has swollen lymph nodes on both sides of his neck and his arm pits but that they go down after a while on their own. If this is not lymphoma or any other type of cancer, I am very relieved but I am very worried and wonder what else may cause this. As far as other symptoms- he is tired a lot but also works a lot. Says no night sweats but works nights. Very thin but always has been. Would love HELP with other opinions on what this could be....

                A few days ago, I noticed a posterior cervical lymph node on the right side of my neck. I've never been aware of it being there until the other day. Upon further investigation (poking at it) it felt a little bigger than the one on my left side. I did have a minor sinus infection, but has gone down quite a bit. I understand that an infection could trigger an enlarged or swollen lymph node, but I've never experienced one in this location. Usually if I get an infection or sore throat, the lymph nodes under my jaw swell up a little. I did go to the doctor today and she felt it and said that it is 1cm or a little bigger which she said is ""normal-ish"", but as she felt a little more she told me that it was barely palpable. I asked her if she had any concerns with it being anything more, such as lymphoma or anything. She said she's not concerned with it. She didn't prescribe any medication, tell me to watch for it or reschedule me for another appointment. She said it's more than likely from the sinus infection. Being a hypochondriac, it relieved me for a little while, but then I had to do some research. My lymph node isn't tender, but it is soft and mobile, which are usually good signs. I'm just worried that I went and had it looked at too early. Can doctors usually tell when they feel a lymph node, if it is a cause for concern? Should I still be worried about it or stop being paranoid? I appreciate any and all responses. Thank you!

                So about 6 weeks ago I noticed a lump on the side of my neck, about 2 inches below where my jaw starts. It feels like it is just below the skin as the skin can move around on top of it and is about an inch in diameter. It is very hard and completely painless. I am 17 years old.

Ive been thinking about it a lot over the past 6 weeks but didn't go to the doctor because I was scared they would tell me I was being stupid and they couldn't feel anything. Well today I finally went to the GP and that is pretty much what happened. I haven't had this doctor before but she was really quite rude and unhelpful. She glided her fingers across my skin and should have been able to feel it slightly (though it is easier to feel if you press and roll the skin on top around it). She then proceeded to ask if I meant the pea sized lump and said it was probably 'just' a lymph gland and that it was nothing. She didn't ask if I had had any infection or anything over this time (which I haven't).

I was embarrassed so left immediately. I was in there for all of 2 minutes.

I haven't really had other symptoms apart from being quite tired, which may be just due to lack of sleep and I have become quite breathless a couple of times but I am not sure if this is just psychological.

Wondering if anyone could give there opinion on the situation. Am I worrying about nothing? Or should I try to see a different doctor?

Thanks.

                Could I have leukemia? Im 16 years old and ive had many health problems, but not cancer. I have asthma and im allergic to sulfa drugs but that's about it. Recently, I noticed that I get very out of breath doing the simplest of things like making the bed for example, or walking a flight of stairs. Im very athletic, and normally this has never been a problem, but it recently began to cause me problems. Besides shortness of breath, I tend to bruise very easily and I have no clue where they come from half the time. I've had this bruise on the side of my knee at the beginning of basketball season (4 to 5 months ago) and it has yet to go away or change color. I played piano one day in school for maybe 50 minutes and ended up with a bruise on my wrist. My joints get exceptionally sore! Im a catcher and my wrist will become sore from holding up the glove. I also have this pain in my leg. Its in the front of my thigh and hurts sometimes when I run or walk, and somedays it disappears. Another symptom is nosebleeds. I remember telling my friend that I had two nosebleeds the other day and she goes, ""Woah, ive never had a nosebleed."" And its weird because I get them quite frequently! And when they do bleed they bleed a lot, and last a long time. Also, if I have one nosebleed later in the day ill have another. Im very pale! Also, ive been passing out. When I stand up from laying or sitting or I reach above my head, I get dizzy, and ill pass out. (very annoying!) and its worse when im taking a hot bath. My gums bleed when brush my teeth and I don't brush them hard. I get nauseous a lot! Ive also had blood in my stool when using the bathroom. Also, my periods are very heavy. Soaking through a tampon in under an hour! and that's not normal, either. I also have some but not a lot of these tiny little purple/bruise colored dots. theyre not very big. please reply, thank you!

                My brother, 51, went to the clinic for what he thought was a uti..blood in his urnine.  Later that day, he got a call from the clinic saying his WBC was 121000 and to go to an ER in a nearby town.  Long story short, he was diagnosed with leukemia, type is still unknown to us.  He had his first round of chemo last week and it ended Friday.  He is having a hard time getting his platelet count back up.  He said they want it over 50 and his is around 37, and they are giving him platelets daily.  Are they just being slow to rebuild on their own, or could it be something more?  He's very frustrated...and still stunned.  How do you go for what you thought was a UTI and end up in a cancer institute?  He was supposed to start a new round of chemo this week, but not sure if they will do it if his platelets aren't coming up.  We are very new to the whole leukemia scene.  He's 3 hours away, so its hard to know 'first hand' whats going on there.

                I am really confused between carvidilol and lisopril. 
About six weeks ago my blood pressure suddenly went up (170/80). As a precaution I went to emergency. They took EKG, X-rays, MRI of the brain and did blood work. Doctors in emergency could not find any problem with my heart and  gave me one dose  of antianxiety medicine and sent me home. Also advised me to see your cardiologist. 

Cardiologist prescribed me carvidilol (6.25mg), Lisinopril (5mg) and Pravastatin. My blood pressure was never more than 140/80 before taking the carvidilol once a day and lisonopril once in a day. I am 71 year old and thought 140/80 is normal for my age. But I took the carvi-lisono 6 hours apart. Carvi causes me light headed for hours and lisonopril caused me short breath and weakness. So I decided to stop lisonopril completely and by doing it caused lot of palpitation and discomfort. Right now I am only taking carvi once in a day. I feel that I don't have any heart disease but these medication making me sick. Please comment. Thanks.

Then it happened a couple of times during the day where she would cry that her legs hurt and she couldn't walk. She literally army crawled across the floor crying.. it lasted a couple of hours then the pain subsided. The following week she wrote from deep sleep crying that her leg hurt again. We took her to the pediatrician just to be sure it was growing pain and not something else. The Dr ordered a blood test to rule things out..it was then she also noticed the bruises on top of her feet (it's the middle of winter so she's usually wearing socks) well the first test came back with elevated liver panel (I don't have the numbers but she did say her alt, ast and alp).. that was on Feb 7.. She asked me to bring her back Feb 18th for another draw and Dr and leg x ray. She also asked the pedi oncologist for advice... he had the Dr run a couple blood tests.. so I received a call from the Dr on Feb 19.. the liver tests went down even though they were still elevated but the tumor marker test (ldh) came back elevated so she was referring me to the oncologist to have an mri does to find any tumors and a bone marrow biopsy to find out if she had leukemia.. so we went to the oncologist two days later. He ran another set of blood tests. This time they were back to normal so he didn't order any additional test. He said she more than likely didn't have any cancer because they were normal and she doesn't look sick and her pain comes and goes..he said if it was cancer her pain would never go away... I was so relieved. But here I am almost two weeks later with a horrible feeling something is wrong.

My daughter complains of pain in her right leg but it's not constant.She wakes up everyday and says her stomach hurts. She's not hungry, it just hurts. If I ask ever she points to right below her rib cage. She is very pale and hasn't always been that way.. I was looking at pictures of her over the last year and she looks so pale she is almost gray. And she doesn't eat very much.. She is growing accordingly so I was told her eating habits are normal..and the child sleeps a lot!! She's still naps during the day.

I don't know if I should see another Dr and get a second opinion.. have an mri to rule out tumors... another blood draw?? I have requested her medical records from both her pediatrician and the oncologist but haven't received then yet.. I'm freaking myself out everyday bring worried I'm not doing the right thing..thoughts??

                Hey I'm a three year survivor from Multiple Myeloma.  It is rare cancer, but even rarer for my age (diagnosed at 32) I did chemo then had an autologus stem cell transplant. June 2010.  

MM is not considered cureable, only treatable, and though I have had a complete remission (no detectable traces in any bloodwork etc) I am always worried I am relapsing, since the dr.'s have pretty much drilled it in my head that I will relapse sooner then later. 

Anyway, that is a whole other post

Question is I ""found"" a hard lump in my neck in January.  I was suffering a lot of sinus infections so I was running my neck as my glands were swollen and acheing.  

Then I felt this hard lump.  It is rock hard, you can't move it or anyting, and it feels smooth, about the size of a quarter or larger as it is right at the bottom of my ear, and then goes under my jaw. 

I am having a CT scan next week of my sinuses, and also my glands to check for infections (my transplant and the chemo left me slightly immune compromised)

I went to my family DR. last week because I kept feeling something caught in my throat.  He felt the lump and suggested and ultrasound.

I have pointed it out to cancer Dr. but she said she could not feel it ans said it was nothing (was recently switched to a different dr. who I have no rapport with, she is difficult for me to communicate as she is here doing a fellowship from Asia)

Anyway, can someone please tell me the best way to image these neck lumps? I know lymphoma often presents this way.  I don't think I have lymphoma, but am worried about Myeloma relapse. It is not uncommon for tumors to form in the head and neck area. Most myeloma stays in the bone marrow but about 15% of patients develop external tumors..

                Hi,

First of all, for reference, I've found this thread very helpful and relevant to my situation: http://www.medhelp.org/posts/Leukemia--Lymphoma-/Swollen-Lymph-Nodes-after-alcohol-consumption/show/385680

I'm a 25 year-old white male, soon to be 26. My concern is that for a year or so, whenever I drink too much (which I tend to, when I do drink), I'll experience not severe but certainly very noticeable pain in what I think to be a lymph node near my left hip. I am not a medical student or professional so this is based just on my own understanding of my anatomy. Usually the pain persists for three or four days, and then I feel ""normal"" again. My own personal history with alcohol is that from 19-24 or so I was drinking too much too often, like many college-aged people do, and in the past year I've throttled it down quite a bit, splurging occasionally only to pay for it the following few days.

Like others in the thread I linked, I was very worried to see that most results for those search terms mentioned Hodgkin's or other forms of lymphoma, which are more serious conditions than I had considered before. 

To add to my concern, I've recently lost weight, though I don't believe it's linked to the weight loss associated with lymphoma, as I've been dieting and exercising regularly for at least six months, and results have come at a reasonable and not worrying pace. But as a result of this weight loss, I've achieved low body fat (probably in the 10% area), and near my hip I believe I can see the lymph that hurts. However, I can't accurately say if this is unusual, because I'm never been at this weight before, so it may or may not be swollen (or something worse), or just newly visible. I can also make out something similar on the other side, though it's smaller and rarely if ever hurts.

Beyond that, I don't generally exhibit any traits associated with lymphoma, other than occasional night sweats, which have been an infrequent occurrence as long as I can remember and still are infrequent, though they do happen. Other symptoms like fever, itchiness, swelling, lack of appetite or energy, other swollen nodes, chest pain, etc., don't really apply to me. And really this pain only occurs after a night of heavy drinking, usually 12-24 hours later.

Ideally this is something I'd take up with my family physician, but I am currently without health coverage and barely make it by as it is, and the costs of undergoing any kind of procedures related to diagnosing this would represent a very significant monetary investment to me, so I'm reluctant to seek help. That being said, nothing is more important to me than my health, even money, and so if it's necessary to seek treatment, I am willing to incur whatever financial costs necessary to ensure my safety.

In light of all of that, I'd very much appreciate any opinions or insight from people more knowledgeable on the matter than myself. Thanks for reading and for you help.

I've included a picture of what I believe to be the node (though for all I know it could be healthy, or a muscle, or anything, really). Thanks again!

                Well, Here I am 4 - 5 weeks after the discovery of a large, painless lump in my collarbone.  Immediately I got up from my magazine read and looked in the mirror to find a huge visible mass where there used to be a dip in my collarbone. I got to researching it and diagnosed myself with a swollen lymph node...which could be the sign of lots of things, or nothing at all according to google, search engines, etc.  I called my doctor and they didn't seem to panic... only alerting me that sometimes they swell, wait a few days and see if it goes down.  Me knowing my body knew that this wasn't the norm.  I did have a ctscan scheduled to check some pain in the joints I'd been experiencing (feeling like I was falling apart)  After the radiologist finished I pulled my collar of my shirt down and said, ""LOOK AT THIS.""  The widening of her eyes and drawback of her body gave me instant gratification that this was not normal.  I waltzed over to my doc office that's next door and visited the window and asked the receptionist, ""Should I wait another week for this too be seen?""   (It seems that was the only appt. available.)    So, it's not that important I guess.

Finally after 2 weeks of waiting to see my family doctor for this lump that hadn't changed... My doctor says, ""Yes, we do need to get that looked at and see what it is.""  Another few ct scans of the head and chest finds several swollen lymph nodes from my neck down into my mediastinum.  According to the reading... ""suggest lymphoma""  Also, the largest lymph mass measuring 8 by 5 by something.  So I cry a few hours, and drive around a few hours going now where.  I'd picked up my reading before the family doctor had received it.  I have to call medical records to have it practically pushed into my doc's lap because they hadn't received it at the office yet.  A few hours later she calls me and tells me she wants to send me to a specialist asap, not to panic from the word lymphoma...this could have lots of other causes....(Right, like none of the other causes troubles me...HIV, Hepatitis, other types of cancers, the list went on.)

So the days drag on...a few days later I see my cancer doc.  I knew this appointment was just going to be the beginning of more and more appts...and it was.  I was scheduled for a CT scan, and MRI of the brain, a removal and biopsy of one of my lymph nodes, and a bone marrow biopsy all within a week, and another week and a few days to wait to see the ""Cancer doc"" once more to see.... WHAT IT IS?  So I'm left here with these words from my doc.  ""It walks like a duck, quacks like a duck, but is it a duck?""  The duck meaning, ""lymphoma"".  So, I'm a sitting duck at the moment...waiting......for the appointment to find out..."" Hey doc, is it a duck?""  ""Is it a flock?""  Do I plan my last family vacation or what?

So in case your all wondering...  Other symptoms.  I had hives one night after discovering the lump, a week later I had hives again.  I've suffered from severe to moderate itching for a while.  I've blindly been fighting fatigue for quite some time.  It seemed nothing could give me energy.  My eyes seemed really dry in the evenings, for a while I've been waking up with a really dry mouth ""like I'm dehydrated""  When I would do my usual work that requires some physical activity I'd become short of breath with just a few stairs to climb....I used to run up and down those stairs no problem.  I thought that the chills were just from the extreme cold of this winter...but they were chills.  I never monitored my temperature...until the past few days.  At the hospital the other day when leaving from bone marrow biopsy the nurse took my temp, left the room, took my temp again, left the room (never said anything), I took a drink of my seagrams on ice, and he came back with an oral thermometer...and an explanation that I had a temp twice so he wanted to check orally....I told him well...I just took a cold drink. The temp read normal and he wheeled me out.  I've noticed the past few nights that i've had a temp of 99.1 - 100.1... but usually it's 99.7.  I've also had some super dooper headaches the past few days...I feel like I'm gonna blank out.

Cool story right.  

Oh yeah....and I think I can feel like every lymph node in my body....Top of thigh, around knee, forearms, upper arms, under arms, back of neck, neck, chest, hips, ... And my calf muscles have been hurting, joints have been feeling fragile.  Health...I miss you!

                I'm a 49 year old female with hypothyroidism, Epstein-Barr virus and Celiac disease.  Since mid-December I've been very fatigued and I have not been able to sleep through the night without a sleeping pill, which I only took out of desperation for a good night's sleep and not very often.  About the same time the insomnia started I noticed my shins began to itch, mostly at night.  That has progressed to itching all over, all day with the intensity worse at night and worse on the lower legs.  Four weeks ago I had several days of unexplained high fever, followed by sinusitis which is something I haven't suffered from in over 15 years.  I tried multiple alternative things to no avail and had to finally see a dr. who noticed I had the beginning of a staph infection in my nose.  Colloidal silver and an antibiotic finally cleared it up after 10 days.  Meanwhile, I had horrible fatigue and lost 10 lbs which I did not put back on after clearing up the sinus condition.  I returned to the doctor who ordered a blood test, chest x-ray and echocardiogram.  The TSH number is fine and the nurse told me that my B12 levels were high.  That sounds odd to me since I have celiac and don't absorb well and I don't take additional B vitamins outside of a good multi.  My concern is the 10 pound weight loss (I'm small framed and now weigh 125) in 3 weeks time, the itching skin, the insomnia and a high B12 level.  Do these symptoms point to leukemia or lymphoma?  I feel like a hypochondriac suggesting it to my doctor.

                Hi everyone,

I have a swollen lympnode under my ear, close to my jaw. I can feel it for 3 months now, i am not sure if its growing. The lymfnode is not painfull, it is hard like a litlle round ball and when i touch it it feels a little bit irritating. I have had no fever or colds in the last months. I do have a dog and maybe i have some sort of allergic reaction cause when i wake up in the morning i have a running nose, not much but it s a reaction to something, maybe my dog.
My dog sleeps in the same room as me. 

I have been thinking about other possible causes:
I also have a wisdom teeth coming trough but not competely, however it s not swollen or infected around my teeth. It is on the same side of my swollen gland so it could be.
Also a month ago i had a pimple in my neck and a lymfnode close to that pimpe reacted by swelling up so i could see the gland in my neck. I think my immuumsystem is my a bit overreacting and maybe this could be the cause of my swollen lymfnode. I worry a lot cause my mom died of leukemia so i am afraid i might have cancer too. I will see a doctor this week and i hope it will not be something serious.

                This morning I visited the doctor complaining about an uncomfortable pain in my back on the right side which has been recurring for the past 5 days - I've also for the past few weeks been feeling very sweaty, drowsy and having recurrent headaches. He did an ultrasound to rule out kidney stones but in the process noticed that my spleen was slightly enlarged. 

Two weeks prior to this I had a medical examination for company health insurance which included a blood test which came back perfectly normal, aside from slightly elevated LDL Cholesterol and ALT(GPT) levels. Despite showing my doctor these results he insisted on doing the blood work.

My question is, can I rule out leukemia and lymphoma as possible causes of the enlarged spleen, given that my previous blood work came back satisfactory? Would such diseases be instantly identifiable in a standard blood work up which includes white blood cell and haemoglobin counts?

Thanks.

They haven't gone down so will be getting a scan on them in a few weeks, however today I woke up and have a weird achy pain on my right hand side and I hear that's linked with Lymphoma. I am hugely anxious and suffer panic attacks so getting to the drs is not easy. The lumps are pretty movable and groin one seems same size though neck seems maybe a big bigger?

                Boy, health issues, many in the last couple years wound up apparently the result of a severe vitamin D deficiency that went unnoticed for years. One very thorough physician assistant scratched her head and said ""I want your vitamin D checked."".  Wow, it was low and once I got it back up many of my health issues improved and some entirely went away, like a horrible pain in my metatarsals of my left foot and other neuropathies like buzzing in my limbs and numbness, chest pains, etc. ANYWAY, sorry for the long intro but interestingly enough just as I was appreciating all these things getting better I suddenly was stricken ill with a horrible gastrointestinal issue that sent me to the ER.  I totally thought they were going to read the ct scan and tell me my pancreas was shot.  The episode was very similar to my gall bladder attack over 20 years ago but actually worse (I am 49) as I recall anyway.  But they took my gallbladder back then so what could it be other than a blocked duct or my pancreas? (is what I thought, scary).  Lots of upper ab pain both on right and then left side and pain settled in the middle radiating out to both left and right, upper mind you. No appetite, and when I did force something it went straight through at the peak producing a very pale stool, again scary, plus the severity of the pain and not getting better.  Couldn't eat and was losing a pound a day, not heavy to begin with....was very scary.  Finally after about two weeks I was able to start eating full meal but was left with stools that don't form and lots of pain and tenderness that feels like it's in my diaphram SP? or in my muscle.  It feels like someone has punched me in my upper gut and it's been 8 weeks now. UGH.  I had an endoscopy an ultra sound and ct scan all showing nothing wrong but my gastro doc even though I was right when I said ""blocked duct""?  Anyway once they didn't find anything on a follow up ultrasound he kinda gave up on me so I went to my gp and she order tests to test for parasites etc  So far they have come  back normal two but waiting on a result for one last parasite. While waiting for this in the last two weeks I have noticed the return of a lymph node on my left arm that was once present 3 years ago.  It is located on my forearm in the radial area a little less than half way from the elbow toward my hand.  At least I believe it's a lymph node.  It is about pea sized, feels like it is shaped about like a kidney bean and moveable.  This time around though it is surrounded by a small path of inflammation that seems like edema. It kind of feels sometimes like there is a slight density in the surrounding tissue...but then I feel like I am obsessing about it and imagining that.  But now also my elbow is sore too, not the area of the lump but the actual elbow.   I don't know.  3 years ago I brought the little knot up to a doc and he said it was another lipoma.  I had a lipoma removed from the same arm on the inner fold of my elbow  about 15 years ago which got huge and interfered with the movement and use of my arm.  The surgeon at that time said they biopsied the fatty tumor and it was benign, but he also said it had grown into my joint and really tangled with the joint making it hard to remove.  I never did ask if he had to remove any lymph nodes with it, didn't even think about it then.  I do recall the tendon running from my elbow to my wrist after that surgery remained taunt for a long time and it had little bumps running all along the tendon, weird, for like weeks and he said it would go away with use of my arm. Anyway, my concern is whether or not it is a lymph node to be concerned about.  There is really not much on the internet about the nodes in that area or much about nodes that have a center with edema surrounding it....I do plan to show it at a women's health appointment next week but am really wanting to learn what I can since it can be so hard to get the docs to pay attention long enough to help. I think I'd like it biopsied. But maybe I have an infection in my body I don't know about...it has been suspected I've had Lyme disease and I do work closely, hands on, with the general public.  What I wonder is is it even a lymph node AND does it sound related to my ongoing upper ab  pain and gastro issues.  Thanks for any insight anyone might offer.  Sorry this is so long. I totally appreciate you reading this whole thing!

                October 2012 started feeling a lump in my throat and plugged ears.  January 2013 started feeling ache in right front side of my neck.  Saw doctor and they had no recommendation except to keep and eye on it to see if it got worse.  The ache came and went over 2013 never getting worse than it was in January.  In October of 2013 started to notice an ache in my right groin area but thought I might have pulled something.  December started to notice an ache under my right arm.  Saw Doctor the end of December and he inquired about a possible infection.  Had an ultra sound performed on neck and armpit area in early January 2014 which came back normal.  Last week or so the ache is on both side in my groin and armpit areas.  Neck ache is still only on the right side.  Have occasional night sweats.  Feel good other than these symptoms.  The plugged ear and lump in throat pretty much went away early last year only coming up briefly every now and then; maybe stress related.  Will be returning to the Dr. to continue checking into the aching nodes.  Anyone gone through this? Any input?

                Hi, I'm 42 asian female no history of any medical disorders although I am a smoker - recently a CBC during routine exam caused my doctor to run a 2nd CBC a month later - results were still not normal so he decided refer to me to a hematologist.  I was not, nor am I now, feeling ill in any way. 

The thing is, I'm failing to understand what the actual concern really is…  Looking at 3 blood results, I have a high WBC in all 3.

April 2013 shows a high WBC of 16.1 - but all other blood levels were normal.
Dec 2013 shows a high WBC of 15.5 as well as high platelet count - but all other blood levels were normal
Jan 2013 shows a high WBC of 16.1, high LYM of 4.5, high GRA of 10.6, and high MCV of 101.0 - all other blood levels normal.

What is the reason there is concern?

                I've discovered a lump located on my lower back. It's between the size of a dime and a fifty cent piece. It's located almost on top of my spine and is not sore to  touch. Any ideas what I may be dealing with. I'm already experiencing numbness in my left foot and I think it's safe to assume it's related to the lump.

                I ask a lot of questions but this is probably one of the weirdest.

I was just pinching around my belly button (don't ask why) and I came upon a tiny lump on the upper right and left sides. It doesn't hurt unless pinched. I'm wondering if this is a fatty tissue that's normal. I know a lot of people wouldn't be feeling around in this area so many probably wouldn't know the answer.

I remember feeling this also back in 2011 and obviously I'm still fine and nothing has grown or become a concern. But I just want to know what it could be. I would ask a doctor but how weird is it to ask him to put his finger in your belly button and feel what your describing. Very odd.

Thanks for any advice.

I would like to know if Leukemia or Lymphoma are the only other major blood diseases that can cause NRBC or is there something less serious.  I have search the Internet but can only find references to infants or critically ill patients - I feel tired but I'm working, working out, doing all the things I usually do.

I'm looking for answers and not afraid of the what those answers would be so you reply would be greatly appreciated.

                Question. When it comes to looking at neck lymph nodes, which would be more accurate or more telling? A few weeks ago I went for a CT scan on my neck. The results said I had about 5 slightly enlarged nodes but in normal size range and there was no Necrosis/dead cells which I have heard is a good sign. Now I'm wondering if those results could be wrong and if they could be inaccurate because I heard that an MRI takes deeper pictures than a CT does.

Any info would be great.

                Ok so a little quick history..

I've been concerned about a small lump that I found in my neck under my jaw almost 9 months ago. It hasn't changed in size. And if it has it growing very slowly. Anyways, I had been playing with the idea of going to get it checked out by getting scans. I decided to finally get it done for my piece of mind. So that day is tomorrow. I'm alittle annoyed it's the week before Christmas. I hope it's nothing like every doctor seems to think. But a part of me is also worried. Im hoping anyone can give me advice or encouragement. I know I'm not going to be able to sleep tonight.

                Hi i've had an enlarged somewhat soft but not squishy cervical LN for about 2 yrs.  i also have a few very soft somewhat squishy ones in neck, &under chin.
When i went to the dr the ultrasound showed normal but showed thyroid nodule (incidental finding).
 Thuroid biopsy showed follicular (? adenoma), "" likely benign"". I went to MDAnderson for second opinion. They were not overly concerned & i've had it( including the whole neck, nodes, etc too)scanned yearly since then( meaning again in 2012& again in 2013).
My concern is that it is still the same size& i don't know what it is.

Is it possible to not know what it is but be pretty safely assured it's not cancer( thyroid or lymphoma) esp since MDAnderson's keeping an eye on it?

I know y'all of course can't know from internet but the main concern is that its not going down. But from experience can you tell me the stats, etc?

Thanks very much, "" iatrofears""

                Hi again everyone.

Last week when I posted a question I felt like I was going out of my mind constantly thinking about these 2 tiny lumps under my jaw. One I noticed for the first time 8 months ago and no growth (to my knowledge) has occurred. The other, right next to it, I first noticed about 2 months ago and no growth with that one either. Both seem to move upon swallowing which I read could suggest a thyroglossal cyst. Although I'm not sure if more than one lump would still be that since everything I've found online talks about one cyst. And I know this sound like a dumb question but what in inches equals cm? I've read that normal lymph nodes are 1cm but what does that equal in inches? Sounds dumb, I know. Or what object can I compare it too? I read a marble or a peanut m&m since those are bigger than regular m&ms, but I'm not sure if those are correct objects to compare. 

At times it seems like the more pointy lump that I found 8 months ago is smaller than other times. I'm not sure if that's the case. But it never feels larger than when I first found it. I still can't see it through the skin just by looking whereas a lot of the images I saw online show the lumps very visible, which to me would mean it's still quite small. I decided to build up some courage and schedule an appointment with my regular doctor after debating with myself if I should put it off until after the holidays, and when I called to make an appointment today, the only opening be has is in February unless they are emergencies. So I'm kind of at a stand still right now. I'm thinking of going back to the walk in clinic I went to 2 months ago but they look at me weird when I walk in there, and there isn't much they can do besides feel it. I think they think I'm crazy. As I've stated in my last post, within the past 8 months I haven't had any leukemia or lymphoma symptoms occur except some daily knee pain which isn't extremely painful or bothersome. So any suggestions of what I should do? Or suggestions on what I could be feeling. The most annoying thing is that I can't actually grab these lumps, I can just rub my finger over them.

The swollen lymph nodes are all together in one cluster on his neck. They have not spread elsewhere.

                Hi all... I'll try to make this short. So in June I noticed my daughter had some enlarged nodes but blood work was ok. These nodes were located in back of neck. They were approx 1cm. We decided watchful waiting. Well 2 months ago I took her for her physical and the DR didn't like the way her nodes felt. This time on her neck just under her chin. Ordered CBC which showed wbc of lymph14.1 elevated neutrophils and low lymphoxocytes. We started antibiotics. After 3 weeks w antibiotics her counts improved this time showing high lymphocytes instead of low. But her lymph nodes on her neck felt bigger so we ordered a ultrasound just to be safe. The DR said the ones that are over 1.5 cm are the ones shed be concerned about. Well the ultrasound yesterday showed them to be 2.98 cm on the left and 2.84cm on the right. How concerned should I be? The DR hasn't reviewed the ultrasound yet the tech last night just told me the sizes....

                I am very worried about my boyfriend. He is 25 and pretty healthy. About two months ago he noticed a swollen lump on his neck. It wasn't painful but very moveable and he could push it around. Several weeks later it started becoming very painful. He went to the doctors and they prescribed him some type of amoxicillin and sent him home. After his last dose he broke out into a full body, severely itchy rash and went into the hospital. They ran tons of tests and CT scans on him. They found that his liver and spleen were both enlarged, his lump was a swollen lymph node about 3 cm, and he had several but not worrisome small, swollen lymph nodes in his groin. His white blood count was normal but his red blood cell count was slightly lower. They tested him for mono, hiv, lupus, etc.. All negative. So they did a fine needle biopsy on his lymph node. It came back also negative. The rash went away about a week later after taking steroids.

Now it's been about a month and his lymph node still hasn't gone down. He went back to the oncologist and they did more blood work. This time they found his red blood cell count and his iron were very low. (i'm not sure the numbers) They also found he had a slight slight fever. However, his spleen and liver had returned to normal. Anyways, they referred him to a gastroenterologist next Tuesday to check for possible ulcers or internal bleeding of some type. The oncologist also said it appears he has anemia.. But they don't know if perhaps cancer is causing it.

They're doing another CT scan Tuesday to check if he's clear for another biopsy to remove a chunk from the swollen lymph node. They said the FNA could have produced inaccurate results.

His symptoms include weakness, fatigue, and dizziness. (possibly from anemia) He has also lost some weight but no night sweats or anything like that. But this is all very confusing and worrisome. Perhaps the low blood count and swollen lymph node could be completely unrelated.. But that seems unlikely. But is cancer likely if his white blood count is normal?

Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

                i am a 39 year old female. about 6 weeks ago i noticed i had, what seemed to be, an enlarged lymph node on the right side of my neck.  i would say it is in the 'jugular' area. at the time i also had a bit of a runny nose and felt like i had a bit of a cold virus perhaps.  i didn't have a sore throat or stuffy nose though.  also no fever. i checked the swollen gland every day and i thought it had gone away after about a week. about two weeks ago i had some chills and slight body aches that lasted on and off for a few days.  then one week ago i woke up and touched my neck for some reason and noticed that the same area was swollen again.  i'm not even sure if it ever went away to begin with. i went to my doctor the next day and she felt around and could barely feel it. it seems like sometimes i can feel it more then other times. my boyfriend also felt it so i know it is there. my doctor did not seem concerned and sent me on my way. i check it a few times a day and it seemed like it was getting smaller a few days ago. last night i was at a bar with my boyfriend having a couple drinks and i felt my neck and i could 'feel' it again. it felt like it originally did. it seems to be about the size of a pea. i don't know enough medically to tell if it is 'fixed' or 'palpable'. after reading all kinds of things on the internet i worry about lymphoma or other cancers. i feel scared, depressed and withdrawn today. physically i feel fine and i have no fevers.  i do have an impacted lower right wisdom tooth that is partially protruding however it does not hurt or feel infected. it has been like that for over ten years. does anyone have any insight? i'm debating on whether to go back to my primary doctor tomorrow. i had my yearly routine blood panel done this past august and all was normal.

                Hi everyone. I posted in the ear, nose, and throat forum and had no luck. Hopefully I will get some here.

About 8 months ago I first found a small hard lump in my neck under my jaw. I can't see it through my skin I can just feel it. I didn't think anything of it until about 2 months ago when I randomly was feeling my neck and felt that same lump again. Now due to my hypochondria, I am obsessed with this lump. It hasn't grown, at least not to my knowledge, since first finding it 8 months ago. I have been to two doctors within the past 2 months to ask them about it. An ENT and a regular clinic doctor. No tests were done. Both just felt it and seemed sure that it felt normal. Clinic doctor suggested a permanent enlarged lymph node but nothing alarming since it felt like a pea. ENT said he didn't think it was a lymph node but a bone. He said if I was still worried to come back in 3 months and he will do testing then but he assured me it wasn't anything serious. It does feel hard and doesn't move which I have read suggests the worst. But I guess the good thing about it is that it doesn't seem to have grown. Someone suggested to me it could be a hyoid bone but after looking at pictures of it on the net I'm not sure that what I'm feeling is in the same place the hyoid bone would be. Another thing is that I can obviously feel it, but I can't grab it. Does this mean or suggest anything? My main worry is obviously cancer, lymphoma or leukemia, but since first finding it 8 months ago I don't have any of those symptoms that those cancers would cause. I would see a third doctor but because I saw those first two doctors weeks apart from each other my insurance has become a problem and I wouldn't get new coverage until the new year anyway and that's why I have been searching the net for questions like crazy. I have also noticed another one, the same small size, almost next to it. I noticed that about 2 months ago for the first time and haven't thought much about that one until now too. That one seems like it's the same pea size but a little flatter. The first one feels more pointy and noticeable. Any ideas or suggestions would be great! The only thing that is literally keeping me from going insane with these lumps is that fact that I read and have been told that small pea size lumps are normal. 

Thanks for any advice and suggestions. :)

                Hello, I'm a 23 year old male and I'm worried I might have lymphoma. For the past 9 months or so I've been experiencing some kind of swelling on my underarms that come and go. It stays swollen and a little painful for about a week and then go away. It has been swollen for the past two days now and has already happened about three other times is this period of 9 months but always go away. I think it is a lymph node, it's round and movable and about an inch in diameter but is very difficult to find since it seems to be located deep under the arm. Sometimes it apparently gets lower though, so I can palpate it. I feel a general tenderness in the area and when I press my arm against my chest it's a little painful, it feels like the node is being compressed somehow. Sometimes only one side is affected, other times both. The first time it happened was right after I took a vaccine so I don't know whether it's related to that. Other two times I don't remember anything out of the ordinary, I don't think I had any kind of infection or anything. This time I took another vaccine about three days ago, so it kind of coincides with the swelling appearing. Could it have something to do with the lymph nodes swelling? I went to the gym a day before the area started getting painful, so maybe it's related to that. Also is it likely for an enlarged node from lymphoma to come and go like this or should it stay swollen if left untreated?

                Hi guys,

My friend's dad was diagnosed with normocellular trilineage hematopoiesis with relapsed/residual chronic lymphocytic leukemia. The 1st phrase, after searching the net, is kinda positive. The 2nd phrase is, after searching the net too, is kinda negative. 

Can someone help us interpret this diagnosis? My friend is very worried, because his dad kept this from him until he saw it yesterday.

Thanks a lot in advance.

I have to consult a doctor next week but before that I wanted to have some idea if you could help me figure it out.

                Hi guys
Just wondering if my daughter had blood noses since she was 2 years old and they are more frequent now. Does leukemia symptoms come on within a few weeks or can you have sypmtoms for years. Does anyone know the link between pesticides and childhood cancer and xrays. Im worried because she had an xray unnecessarily when she was  1 and half years old on her chest and upper abdomen. Also the unit complex we live in did not inform us that they were doing anuually termite pesticide sprays while I was 7 weeks pregnant and when she was born.

                Hello all,
I apologize for the length of this...

Last September, out of the blue, I started feeling very fatigued, and I noticed a lot of swollen lymph glands in my neck. I also started experiencing severe pain in my leg bones that felt like they where on fire. It was excruciating. 
I saw my doctor, and they did blood tests, my WBC was low, and they did an ultrasound which showed my lymph nodes where very swollen. My doctor didn't do anything, or seemed concern. After trying to get help from that doctor for 6 months, I gave up, and switched clinics. My new doctor diagnosed me with and UNDERACTIVE thyroid. Which seemed really strange because I hadn't gained any of the weight I had lost.
Anyways, for a few months after taking thyroid medicine I started to feel better, and get a bit more energy.

Well the very end of August, my pain started again, and I've been experiencing new symptoms. I began to loose more weight, you can now see my spine and ribs. My spleen is swollen, my liver enzymes are elevated, I'm experiencing night sweats almost every night, and I'm SO tired I can hardly speak sometimes. I'm also bruising really easily, and I now have swollen lymph nodes in my armpits and groin.
He preformed more tests, and my lymphocytes are on the high side of normal, almost at the limit, but my RBC and platelets are on the low end of normal. He had a CT with contrast done on my lymph nodes in my neck, but that came back looking normal. Now I'm being referred to and ENT. What do ENT's do? Should I be worried? Am I crazy?

I'm just getting so frustrated that after a year I don't know whats wrong. I should be better, but i'm getting worse. I am a 22 year old female.

Thanks!

                Just wondering if anyone has heard/seen anyone else with NHL-MALT's that was in the first Gulf War. My husband served over there. He had no signs or symptoms, he ended up in the hospital with severe abdominal pain one weekend.  After several tests and 5 days later of not being able to eat anything, surgery was performed and a mass was found in the small intestine that had ulcerated through to the mesintary (the doctors stated it had been there a long time). I've been reading about the MALT lymphoma, this is nothing that just starts overnight. Wanting to see if there is a link from enviromental exposures (ie: burning oil fields, unexploded missles, etc). Very rare for his age (at the time 41) and area of tumor. 
Thanks for any information.

                A quick recap. . My daughter has had enlarged nodes since June throughout her entire body.  She's tiring more easily and has had about 4 or 5 fevers in the last month but I contributed them to flu season. Herr doctor did labs and I got some of the results yesterday.  Her wbc was in the normal range but had a left shift.  Her liver function came back abnormal.  A test for inflammation came back elevated. The snap test for lymes came back positive but two other tests that tell you how advanced the lymes is came back negative which my doctor has neverseen before so we are waiting on the final for lymes but my doctor said if it was lymes those two other tests are always positive.  So now I wait. .. and im impatient.  If this final lymes is negative she wants me to see a hemocrat specialist at children's.  Any advice?

                Hi all
In June I noticed my daughter had 2 swollen nodes.  I took her to the doctor who did a CBC and said it was normal so I kind of forgot all about it.  She just went to a check up with our new family doctor who immediately noticed her enlarged nodes.  The 2 I was talking about located on the back of her neck plus all of her nodes in her neck and her aarmpit and groin. She ordered more labs the only one I've gotten back was today when I called and asked a nurse if they were in yet.  She said her ESR or Sed rate is at a 20 but then said she couldn't tell me anymore results because the doctor hasn't reviewed them because she's out of the office until tomorrow. I googled normal ESR rates for children and they are 3-13. Should I be concerned? Obviously ill talk too the doctor more but wanted to know What if any kind of specialist I should be seeing?  I live in a small town and need a referral in order to go to children's. Should I request a biopsy since her nodes have been enlarged for at least 4 months?
Thank you.

                Hi, just needed to talk because I am scared about what is happening- I've had a small red mark on my neck for years but in April it became swollen and I started to feel very tired. In May I got waxed for charity and soon after this lumps appeared under my armpits. The first two doctors I saw thought these were lymph nodes but on the third inspection by a different GP (it's pot luck which GP you see) I was told the armpit lumps were folliculitis and my neck was likely swollen due to the infection. This passed but my neck has gotten worse- the neck preceded the armpits but I was initially so relieved at the doctors diagnosis that I forgot this. On returning to yet another GP I was treated very dismissively and told I could expect to wait 3 months for the swelling to go down following folliculitis- I did nothing for the next few months despite feeling worse and worse. I was referred eventually to see a hospital doctor two weeks ago and In the last week I have been fatigued and sleeping from 12-16 hours a night. I have bled from my mouth during the night and after a few days of this and a 16 hour sleep I was persuaded to go to hospital where the doctor found a lump. I have had sporadic night sweats and a feeling of discomfort if not pain below my left ribs, my abdomen has hurt a little recently and Ive lost 25 pounds since April. My armpits hurt a bit at times but no obvious lumps are there. Ive got a CT scan in 9 days, the hospital doctor who arranged this did so because he could not find a lump in the swelling at the time but was uneasy about what I told him. I feel stiff in my neck at times and alcohol causes a hot but fairly minor sort of pain. My blood results are okay but I am really scared about cancer still- any other ideas what this is because 9 days feels like forever away and sleeping for 15 hours is beginning to affect my life quite badly. This is on top of a relationship breakdown so I'm really, really low. Stress could factor but it's never done this to me before! Other funny things are a permanent bruise on my leg and cold/numb left hand, my thermostat is positively bipolar too with being both hot and cold at odd times. In a funny way Im scared of the scan finding nothing because this is so inconvenient and I can't function successfully at present. Im 31 years old and I wondered if any of this sounded familiar to anyone? Scared.

It's now October (5 months) and thru are not down, occasionally they are tender, but aside from that I have no symptoms. 

I had my annual physical in September. They drew blood and did not see an elevated white blood count. My question is how long do I let it go without another doctor visit to an ENT doctor specifically. I posted this tonight because they are a little tender which drove me to google.....

                I posted this in a different forum but I thought I should post it here also.

Hello,

Here is my question.  In Aug, my general doc said that it felt like my left node was a little swollen in my neck but she didn't seem to worry about it so I basically forgot.  Then sometime in November I noticed them again.  I thought it was related to the camp fire we were sitting in front of so I brushed it off.  After a few weeks I started feeling bad and I was having post nasal and ear congestion.  I went to a doc and she said it was congestion and gave me mucus meds.  Then I went somewhere else and she said I had strep and gave me 10 days of antibiotics.  I took those but my nodes didn't go down.  Those meds were over around Dec 10th.  

Last week I went to an Allergy/Sinus doctor that did a CT scan and allergy testing.  The results came back that I had a small amount of infection in one of my sinus cavities.  He said he wanted to put me on 3 weeks of antibiotics.  He didn't seem very concerned about the lymph nodes since they aren't fixed, tend to move and not huge; one is about 1.5 cm.  

I told him I wanted a 2nd opinion so I went to another doctor the next day.  He said that he would recommend that I take 3 weeks of antibiotics and that he didn't think my lymph nodes were related to cancer.  He said they should decrease within the 3 weeks.  The thing is that it has been a week and they are still the same size.  Here are my questions:

1)  Since Lymphoma only really has one symptom, can someone have it without having fixed, rubbery nodes?  Is there a true way that lymphoma related lymph nodes feel?

2)  Since I'm worried should I go ahead and get a biopsy?  Neither of the doctors are in a real rush but I just want to make sure.  I'm tired of worrying.


Thanks!

I visted doctor who asked me that its a viral. Fever was gone on Tuesday but I felt a painful lump in left underarm. It was about round in shape and was bummed toward outside. Skin was red. Doctor told me that its a sweat gland infection. He gave me some anti biotics. size of Lump has decreased and pain is gone and my medicine course is on. Thing to worry is, I have had a CBC, which shows High percentage of Lymphocites and Low percentage of Neutrophils.Plsease go though picture. Now I'm worried if I am suffering from some kind of serious blood disease. Please guide me.

                -Excuse my English, I am a 21 year old female from Greece.
Hello, I am sorry if I waste your time for this, but I am honestly desperate!
To begin with, I have always been easy to get sick from anything. When I was little, I had had scarlet fever, food poisonings, chicken pox, allergies to washing machine powders/antibiotics and cats and I have had all my life constipation (though now that I am smoking it has gone away) and my right tonsil is enlarged +Every time I go on vacation I have lowgrade fever.
When I was 17 years old I got the swine flu. This year (2010) after the swine flu was past, I had for several days everyday low grade fever with no other symptom. Summer 2010 I got mononucleosis. From winter 2010 until Summer 2011 I had everyday ""back of the head"" headaches which my GP translated as stress and bad posture (I used to spend TOO MUCH time on the computer) and since summer 2011 I have been tortured by my enlarged adenoids which caused me having stuffed nose all the time, phlegm in the back of my throat and I occasionaly spit blood. My G.P. gave me this saline nasal spray and since then I had been doing great. Then, in Summer 2012, I started smoking. Since Summer 2012 my adenoids have been giving me a hard time but I get NO blood from mouth/nose and stuff. In spring-summer 2013 I got piercing stomach aches in the upper abdominal area and heartburn. These symptoms lasted for a few days and I thought it was too much smoking. I also have occasional recurring left frontal neck pains which my G.P. said are probably muscular because of the coming-going. In May I had an episode of myalgia (doctor said it was due to infection) which went a way after some hours. In early June 2013 I went on a summer school and had shortness of breath and severe constipation (I always get constipation when going on vacations). I went to a local doctor who examined my respiration and belly he told that my respiration was fine and my impression of shortness was due to stress). The shortness of breath went away after I had a bowel movement after a gastroenteritis which troubled me and many of my fellow students. In my summer vacation in a small island of Greece (mid July- end of August) I started getting worse pains and heartburn in the upper abdomen. I also experienced redness (that lasted for 10 minutes) on face after getting out of the sea water. In the beginning of my vacations I had diarrhea that lasted for 10 days (I thought it was due to a food poisoning and lack of aftercare - I drank cocktails, ate everything a person with diarrhea shouldn't) but my feces remained soft (not diarrhea though) until I returned in my hometown. So I thought it was just traveller's diarrhea. A week after I returned home from vacation I started getting hives after the shower (no matter what the water temperature). I changed soaps, shampoos, towels EVERYTHING...even if plain water touches my face i get full of hives which go away after 20-40 minutes. I also washed my face with filtered water and no hives appeared. And I itch sometimes but it's not excrusiating and it passes after some seconds/minutes. I don't have enlarged lymph nodes, I feel my right tonsil kinda big in my mouth but it's always been that way, I don't sweat at night, alcohol doesn't do something to my stomach. BUT LOOK AT ALL THIS! I am now DESPERATE. Looking at my history terrifies me and I think I have something really serious. Doctor sais everybody gets sick and it's not a big deal. As you can tell I am a severe hypochondriac, but I read about hodgkin's lymphoma when searching for my hives: People ignored changing symptoms for years and ended up with lymphoma. I had MONO which is a risk factor, my immune system doesn't seem pretty good and I am 15-40 years old. I AM IN PANIC! HELP ME! My doctor sais that most of all the symptoms I ever had were a result of my severe anxiety and hypochondria and sais not to worry. My parents think I'm being crazy and over the top too, but I can't stop being afraid. Do you think I have lymphoma or is it just my immune system?

Thank you and sorry for the long post

                Hello!

I have posted on this site numerous times before and have always found everyone to be helpful.

My new reason for posting has to do with a tiny pea size lump I found a little over 6 months ago under my jaw, above the Adam's apple. I THINK that it is somewhat moveable but at times I'm not even sure if I'm grabbing it at all. But either way as I said I first found it 6 months ago and I haven't seen any growth since. If anything it may have shrunk a tiny bit but I'm not sure. 

I realize that the obvious solution would be to go to a doctor but insurance is an issue for me now and I don't have money to be able to pay out of pocket for any tests that I may need. So that is why I am asking for any advice as to what this could be.

So I guess my question is would this have grown a noticeable amount if it were cancer within the past 6 months?? And would I have experienced any symptoms by now?  And is it good that I haven't noticed any change in the small size?? 

Thanks for all advice and help.

                It all started two weeks ago when I noticed a painful scab on the top left side of my head. After a few days of having this painful scab, I developed a lump behind my head, also on the left by my hair line. A day after this, another lump appeared right above the other one which caused me to go to the ER to get it checked out since I was worried. The ER doctor diagnosed me with a scalp infection and said the lumps were my lymph nodes because they are trying to fight the infection and that is why they are all on the same side. I was given antibiotics which got rid of the pain from the scalp infection and got rid of the scab. It also got rid of the second lump that had appeared.

The first bump I had was painful at first but after finishing the antibiotics it still hasn't really gone down from what I can feel but the pain that was associated with it has gone away. I have also developed 2 very tiny pea sized or even smaller bumps on the left side of my neck which appeared towards the end of my antibiotic treatment. Out of worry, I went to ER again and this doctor told me the one I was mainly concerned about feels like my lymph node and my neck ones don't seem to be related to my infection but don't seem to be something I should be concerned about. 

He checked the rest of my body for lumps (under arms, stomach, groin area, etc.) since he knew I was worried about lymphoma. He then gave me a speech about how he wouldn't recommend for me to get a CT scan for it because of the radiation I would be exposed to and how I can risk my thyroid and my head in general if I get a CT scan on my head and neck area. He didn't feel that I should be concerned about my lumps and mentioned that sometimes they take long to go down or sometimes they don't go down at all.

For several months I had been having a problem with my left ear where I would hear ringing or buzzing sounds in them and now the same thing started happening to my right ear. After two days of having the ringing buzzing experience in my right ear, a similar bump like the one on my left side has appeared almost identical and symmetrical to the one on the left. I have no idea what is going on with me if I am still fighting off some sort of ear infection or if something more serious is going on. As of now, the bumps don't hurt they just irritate me because I know they are there. I would have thought that if I had a ear infection, the antibiotics would have taken care of it but I am not sure. I would appreciate any sort of help or ideas since lymph nodes and lymphoma are all new to me. I am also 22 years old.

                About 3 days ago I started experiencing left flank pain that would sometimes radiate to my left shoulder.  Along w/ that I have had more frequent unremarkable bm's and the most worrisome thing was 3 quarter sized bruises on my left ribcage area that I have no idea where they came from other than just showing up.  I'm on prilosec and have gerd under control.  I went to the dr who felt every organ and asked questions.  I have no fever and no other symptoms.  Dr stated it could be ibs (which still doesn't explain bruises) but she wanted me to get blood work to review it and possible ultrasound.  Should i be worried about leukemia?  Am I over thinking this and it's just ibs and maybe bruised from me grabbing that area so much lately?  I really hate bloodwork and just had some done in Feb for normal physcial and was unremarkable except elevated cholestrol.  Any info/insight would be GREATLY appreciated.

                I went to the ER with severe pain in the upper left flank. CT showed a mass with possible hemmorage. Did MRI with and without contrast.
""Nodular density arising for or adjacent to the anteromedial aspect of the left adrenal gland.  The nodule is somewhat ill defined and irregular in contour. The lesion fails to demonstrate signal drop of on out of phase imaging. Findings are inconsistent with adrenal adenoma. Question of adjacent adenopathy abutting the adrenal gland should be considered. Following the demonstration of contrast, there is mild, heterogeneous enhancement. Findings are inconsistent with pheochromocytoma.""

I know what most of this means.  the out of phase, means it is not fat or lipid rich. heterogenous means it could be made up of more than one thing. I am essentially looking for a second opinion on what this means.

                Hello... ok I am a 26 yr old male 200 lbs with no history or family history of anything. My concern is that I have been getting swollen tender lymph nodes under my arm since about 4 or 5 years ago. They come and hurt then they pain goes away and in a week or so they are gone. Recently I had one on my groin.. same process with that one. Now I have a couple questions I went runing and overexerted myself and a few days later started feeling pain in my testicle that radiated to my groin and a little in my lower abdomen. Shortyly after I felt the groin lymphnode. Could that be a possible reason for that to swell? And does lymphoma present with swollen painful node there in that area?. As u know now my concern is cancer of the lymph node. Does the first issue with the underam node swelling sound like it might be cancer? Also does lymphoma symptoms accur like that were they come and go and return? I have been getting them consistly a number of times per year. Im scared that it might be lymphoma.  Another question...is there a type of illness werw lymohnodes are very very sensative? Like maybe there swell and get tender more often that normal peopl withput cancer?. Im sorry to bombard you with this but with the answers I would feel a whole lot better. 
Oh to add my dr. Said that it was fine and my blood work was normal. I just want to know y they come out and go away so often and if thats a symptom of cancer. If not could there be another reason y.

it, can you please make me understand what is the report saying... The report is as follows...

Clinical Findings:: Cervical lymphadenopathy posterior triangle larger one m/s -1.5X1.5Xms, smaller one m/s-1X0.75cms, Mild tenderness, No Matting.
Microscopic Exam:: Multiple smears studied show mixed population of lymphoid cells, centoblasts,centrocytes,immunoblasts,histiocytes with intracytoplamic nuclear bedris, in a background of 
hemorrhage. No other pathology noted.

                I am hoping someone can answer some questions for me.  I have posted numerous sites, boards, etc an not found much.  My story starts on May7.  I felt something behind my right ear, felt like a bite, itchy, burn and I felt a bump.  My husband looked at it and said it is not a bite so I realized it was a node.  It was not huge and everyone who has seen said it was not worrisome.  My doc put me on antibiotic anyhow and it took almost a month to go away.  In that time I felt crappy, achy, muscles, joints, back, and so on.  Nothing in particular more general and not the same thing everyday.  Then on June 13 my left foot was swollen with pitting edema.  I had an ultrasound and it showed no clot but a node in the groin (I just found out recently the node was 26 cm).  Then I had CT of abdomen and pelvis and that was negative except showed nodes both groins (23 & 24 cm).  Both these tests did not suggest biopsy or malignancy, said nodes appeared reactive.  My doctor watched me and my foot and it continued to swell and go down.  Lasix did nothing at all for it.  I have had tons of labs that are normal.  My symptoms went away in June/July.  My problem has been my foot swelling causing pain and aggravation.  I had a repeat ultrasound last week and it showed the nodes still both sides (16 cm now).  My foot has been better the past week and a half it has not swelled up.  I seen a vascular surgeon he was useless said lymphedema and gave me stockings but I want to know why the nodes are enlarged.  I am an RN and my husband is in medical sales.  I know my MD very well and when he called the other day with the ultrasound report my husband gave him an earful saying figure this out.  So he has ordered my an oncology consult (which I have no appt yet), another vascular surgeon ( no appt yet) and a PET scan for this Thursday.  Last Friday I went to see a general surgeon, on my own who I know, and he reviewed everything and said don't worry the nodes are going down.  He suggested not having the pet and waiting.  Now when they did the ultrasound last week my groins felt like they were a hot mess after.  I had pain, achy there and they felt inflamed and hot from her pushing that probe.  I don't feel the nodes in my groin.  I did feel one this summer when I jammed a table into my groin I developed a node that went away.  Now this weekend I worked and I felt good, me feet felt good.  Now today I have a tender spot on my mid-neck and feel a little pressure in my throat and I feel a node.  Not huge just there.  Behind my right ear I don't feel the node but I have inflammation back there behind the ear, my doc says he doesn't feel anything.  Today I feel a little achy and tired but I worked all weekend and did some clinical time today getting up early.  My tiredness has not been keeping me down.  I have no night sweats, no fevers.  I am overweight so I related all these symptoms to my weight and need to get active until the nodes arised.  I don't know what to do.  My doctor does navy work and left Friday for a week to serve so I can't contact him.  Should I just go have this PET done and see what it shows?  I know if it is infection that can show on PET also.  Does this sound like anything to worry???  When I get a node it is tender, sore that is what draws my attention to it.  Please offer some comments

                I was diagnosed with Pancreatic Insufficiency, positive fecal lactofarin and enlarged common bile duct and lymph nodes with FDG uptake (max) in my abdemon. They had two failed biopsy attempts. I have had many tests scans and procedures in an attempt to find the primary tumor but they can't.  The only thing is an adnexal mass that did not show up on the PET. I have a history of Cervical Cancer in '96 and it was originally thought by the Radiologist that the disease had returned but my Gynecological Oncologist (Hopkins) denied this as any truth due to the fact that this was over 15 years ago and i had a radical hysterectomy in which all disease was removed.  She washed her hands of her specialty and sent me to a gastroenterologist and this is where they diagnosed the Pancreatic Insufficiency which is severe.  I have ongoing symptoms; one being sleeping at least 15 hrs a day on a regular basis, so you can imagine it has destroyed my life.  I am incredibly frustrated because of all the doctors i have seen (Hopkins) they seem to start with a passion to find the answer and agreeing that it is imperitive,  but when the tests come back unexpectedly or confusing they just refere me to someone else and they seem to wash themselves of this.  I'm so frustrated.  Especially cause i never expected this of Hopkins and on one of my last blood tests not only does it continue to show a slight elivation of WBC but this time the platelettes were significantly low. At times i figure to forget it and move on, wait till something significant happens but then other times i get scared and mostly frustrated with the symptoms and i just want to know so i can fix it.

                Hi all,

1 week ago, I discovered a swollen lymph node in my left arm pit. It was a little under an inch in diameter, red, tender, painful, and hot to the touch. 

Now it has been a week, and it is a bit smaller, but no longer painful or red. It definitely hurts when I squeeze or provoke it, but is generally just kind of ""there."" 

In the past, I have had problems with a swollen spleen (discomfort around left upper rib cage) and currently have hypersensitivity to insect bites. 

I don't have any other symptoms other than the swollen lymph node and hypersensitivity--no fever, no nightsweats, no chills, no swollen lymph nodes at the neck or groin, no recent injuries, no fatigue, no sore throat...nothing.

I googled some of my symptoms and CML--a chronic type of leukemia--lists symptoms of swollen lymph nodes that are painless, hypersensitivity to insect bites, and swollen spleen..just immune system problems that occur over a long period of time. Is my swollen and now shrinking lymph node something to worry about? Should I get blood work done? Is there a possibility it being cancerous?

Sorry if I sound ridiculous. I'm kind of turning into a hypochondriac...

                I am a male and 2 weeks after having protected vaginal sex/unprotected oral sex (both ways) and 6 weeks after unprotected vaginal and oral sex, my submandibular glands swelled for about 7 days accompanied by a sore throat.  The symptoms seemed to go down and the next day I had a painful bump about 2 inches above my penis.  It took about 8 days to heal.  Soon after, the same glands swelled again and the sore throat returned.  A couple of weeks later I had 3 tiny blisters form on the edge of my penis head that quickly formed into one sore that scabbed over and actually healed in about three days.  I had all STD tests completed and all came back negative.  Specifically, the HIV test after 138 days post last possible exposure was negative.  From everything I read, that is considered conclusive.  As far as STD's, the syphilis test was completed 37 days after the last possible exposure, so I'm still a little worried about that.  But that being said, and excluding all STD's, my submandibular lymph nodes have remained swollen with a sore throat for 11 months now.  The pattern of swelling for a week to a week and a half with sore throat and subsiding for a few days, only to come back once again has continued and has even gotten a little worse causing slight headaches, dizzyness and fatigue.  No night sweats.  No loss of weight or appetite.  CBC and Comprehensive Metabolic Panels normal.  Could this have anything to do with any type of Lymphoma?  Should I be in any way still worried about HIV?

                Good day! I found a small lump in the right side of my neck. It doesn't hurt. I cannot even see it but I can feel it. It seems to move a little when I want it to. I can say that it is really inside my neck. A relative told me that maybe it is a swollen lymph node. By the way, I am now in my middle term of treating tuberculosis and I'm now feeling fine. When my tb was diagnosed it was a latent one, which means I didn't feel any symptom of it (no cough, no night sweats, etc.). It was only found in my X-Ray which stopped me from getting a job. 

My question is, could this lump be a swollen lymph node due to the treatment I am taking to fight off tuberculosis?

                I am concerned about risk of lymphoma.  I've had a rash for a year that doesn't really change no matter what I put on it.  Dermatologists in past have never listened; they just write an Rx for their useless anti-inflammatory creams and never biopsy anything, even when they admit they can't tell what some rash is.  I've already tried 2 antifungals, sunshine, tea tree oil, neem, Cortaide cream, etc.  It is itchy and measures about 3 inches by 1 inch, just pink to red, fine bumps.  I have Celiac disease and am gluten-free, little dairy, no nuts.  It took a few years to get my weight up to normal, and honestly it may be menopause that helped me get up to 125 at 5'6"".  I started at 108 in 2009 at diagnosis, and plateaued at many weights that were too low, no matter how much I ate.  Never had a biopsy to check on damage to small intestines, but it took almost 4 years to gain all my weight back.  I had symptoms of anemia - fuzzy brain, cold all the time, and took iron.  Numbers now good and I feel much better, but still cold!  When I finally get warm enough, then I get a hot flash, which abates as soon as I take off the layers of blankets.  I can't have a colonoscopy cause they can't get a scope through.  I just want a biopsy of the rash but I am afraid insurance won't cover it.  Would it show lymphoma?  I can't find any swollen nodes and my limited blood work was fine.

                Hi i hope everyone is well. I am a 24 year old female that has had some imaging biopsy and blood work done this past year. I started teaching this year and started worrying about my health and looking for lumps in my neck and I found one. My pcp checked me out and said I did have enlarged lymph nodes in my neck and under my jaw. She checked me for mono and it came back negative. I was referred to get an MRI of my neck and the report said that I had multiple swollen lymph nodes mostly at level 2b with the biggest measuring 1.8 cm and that it could be do to lymphoma. I was than referred to an oncologist who performed blood work that came back perfect. He checked my spleen neck stomach under arms etc and said he couldn't feel much but noticed an enlarged thyroid. So he ordered. Chest abdomen and pelvis ct. Everything came back normal. I was than referred to an ENT who requested a neck ct that showed exactly what the MRI did enlarged lymph nodes in the neck submandibular space and supraclavicular space. She said it was normal but that she would have me get a fna biopsy. My ct also showed a normal thyroid. I got the fna biopsy and it was inconclusive and had another done and was poked many times because the radiologist said that at this other hospital he would get a read and he did it came back negative for cancer cells. I've had zero symptoms accept body aches but after the ok biopsy they left. Four months later I've felt daily ear pain and pain in my lymph nodes like a stinging sharp pain in lymph nodes in my left and right neck by my collar bones on shoulder and armpits. It'd very scary I hate the pain that I get and I also feel pain behind my left eye. I feel like I get a pressing down pain in spots in my Stomach and knees also but the most pain comes in ears neck and shoulder nodes. Can anyone give me suggestions about what may be going on and headaches but not too painful. Thanks

                For several years when I drink alcohol I've noticed lymph node pain upon my first drink. The tenderness will last for a few days after. This started in my teen years but I never told anyone because I didn't want them to know I had alcohol. 

I'm 26, F. In 2009 I was diagnosed with hypothyroidism.  In 2012 I had a FNA done to check a nodule that was on my thyroid.  It was not cancerous but they couldn't determine exactly what type of nodule it. I'm supposed to have a repeat FNA if growth is detected,  it's actually shrunk (last measured in November '12). I was also told in 2012 (Feb) that I was positive for Epstein-Barr and had slightly lowered liver function.  My doctor ran all sorts of blood work and even a stool sample. Everything was normal in his opinion. I was recovering from a bad stomach flu I had 2 months prior and he felt there was nothing to retest or test further. At that time I complained about the pain with alcohol, extremely tired, dizziness and joint pain. He told me to eat better and exercise more and u should feel better. Well it's a year and a half later and some symptoms do, but others linger.


My question is, is it even possible to have Hodgkins for 10+ years and doctors miss the signs or blood work never tip them off? This is the only thing that comes up for alcohol related node pain. what else could cause it?

                So, I have been getting the run-around for nearly 3 years now. 
I am 39 years old. Complete hysterectomy 14 years ago. No estrogen therapy as I have fibrous breast tissue.
My recent blood work platelets 559,000 wbc 13.9 and have a swollen lymph node. I am consistently tired and achy as if I have a chronic flu. Low grade fever that comes and goes and extreme nausea (taking Zofran, Maxeran & gravol for this).
I also have tiny red pin sized spots all over my body. They are not itchy, or raised, but more appear all the time. (They look similar to beauty spots/freckles but are red)
I tested positive for H.Pylori back in Novemeber, but as my alergies prevent any antibiotic treatment, I could only take Tecta & Pepto Bismol for treatment. 
I have a gastroscopy consult this month.
Any suggestions as to the cause and treatments or exams to pursue would be greatly appreciated.

                Dear Medhelp:

Case: My baby is 8 Month 1 week Old.. recently we observed Swelling of Parotid Area and consulted a Doc for the same...up on Ultra Sound for Parotid and neck region, the following report was presented..
(a) E/o Multiple intra parotid lymph nodes noted bilaterally measuring 5-6mm.
(b) Level II lymph nodes noted (right>left) measuring 1.2-1.5 Cms likely to be inflammatory lymph nodes
(c) Visualised vessels appear normal

Impression:- Multiple Bilateral intraparotid and Level II cervical lymph nodes (right>left)-likely to be inflammatory.

Questions:-
(a) The above case was diagnosed as Infection and anti-biotics (MOXCLAV) was suggested.Does this condition be hereditary or a congenital disease.

(b) What is the next level of this condition and which test and pin-point the actual state of the problem..(Like lymphoma, malignancy or infection).

(c) What dietary and day to day care has to be taken to cure the enlarged lymph nodes (as in the report).(We live in Heavy rainfall area of Kerala and coastal karnataka)

Kindly elaborate on the above condition and suggest if the course of action prescribed is fit to the cause.
Expecting your reply.. Regards

Tylenol or Motrin keep the fever down until they wear off.   He has a negative chest x-ray, a negative urine, a negative mononucleosis screening, negative strep.  His throat is very sore and he thinks it is because a swollen lymph node in his neck is swollen into his esophagus.  He has had aching joints, a headache and it hurts for him to turn his eyes.  He has had significant nausea, no vomiting.  He has eaten only a few bites and has lost 15 lbs.  You can see quarter sized swollen lymph nodes when he turns his neck.  His WBC is 3.1, his PLT is 80 and his LYMPH is 0.9.  the rest of the values are normal. Thank you for any advice.

                Hi, I'm curious about what my lymph nodes are doing- over the last few weeks I've had them swelling in different areas: armpits, neck and bum. They are tender but not that sore in the scheme of things. The worst is that I have been really tired and oversleeping, antibiotics have done nothing to clear it up. My white blood cells are lower than average but not too far out of normal range, the first doctor I saw wasn't worried about it. My chest looks a bit swollen and my abdomen feels off- hard to explain as it doesn't hurt. The second doctor I saw said to come back after the antibiotics were done, assuming that the dwellings haven't gone away. I'd say they are worse! Any ideas?

I really don't want to make this post long but I do have a history of Cancer. I was diagnosed in 2004 with a different type and treated.  Surgery and Chemo and Radiation.  
I was in remission about 4 years and then the Pet scan came back positive for NHL.  I've been receiving ongoing treatment.  Last Chemo was about 2 years ago.
I see all doctors on a regular bases and have bee doing very well.  Now I have a problem and not sure what to do.
I've been alone since 2000 and all pap's have always been normal. I just had a pap done and showed HPV.  
I met someone last year and he's very aware of my medical history.  He does have Diabetes but has regular blood work-ups every 3 months. 
I told him about the abnormal pap and he did call his doctor and had blood work done... everything was fine.
Now my question?   I haven't been with anyone except him for 13 years,, how did this happen?
What dangers should I look out for due to the fact I have NHL and now HPV?

                I posted around a year ago around a lump I had discovered on my neck, over the course of the last year I have had an ultrasound and blood work all of which came back ok and whilst I understand that neither are 100% conclusive these coupled with the fact that it has not grown at all over the last year has given me a degree of comfort and my doctor explained that it is not unusual for nodes to be asymmetrical to their counterpart on the other side of the neck which I cannot feel.

About 6 weeks ago I had a painful lymph node under my chin (centre) it was accompanied by a cold-sore on my lip so I was not overly concerned and it went down shortly after the sore disappeared.  About 2-3 weeks ago however I discovered a very small lump under my left arm pit, it was painless and moveable.  I went to my doctor however he was off and was seen by a stand-in who said it was a cyst not a node but agreed to me having more blood work done.  A week later(last Friday) I went to see my proper GP who said that it was a node and not a cyst (face palms) but that it was small and he was not worried about it, he also said that my blood work was normal from the week before.  His feeling was that my blood work and the node were consistent with my body fighting off a virus rather than anything more sinister, although other than the cold sore from a few weeks before I have felt 100% fine.  We agreed that to put my mind at rest I would have more blood work done in a few weeks and I would see him again in a month.

Almost a week on from that the node under the arm has definitely gone down although I can still feel it so hopefully in a few more days that will be completely down, today however I have noticed something else which is a lump (again very small) in the middle of my thigh, pretty much half way between my knee and hip on my quad muscle just under the skin, it’s not red or sore and as far as I can tell is nowhere near where I would expect to find a node.  Could they however be connected in anyway? Or  am I putting 2 and 2 together and coming up with 5 here and being un-necessarily paranoid? ordinarily I would not even bat an eyelid at it.

                Hello I am 31 yrs old and recently had went in to have the lump under my left arm checked out. The doctor ordered an ultrasound and they are telling me that it doesn't look like any type of cancer. I'm concerned however because my lymphocytes have been elevated for a while, now I have the lump under my arm. Could this be a sign of a cancer somewhere else in my body since the nodes they looked at under my left arm look normal? I feel like **** most of the time and very fatigued. I was diagnosed with fibromyalgia a couple years ago. Could it be linked to that? Also I have two symptoms that I'm not sure where they are coming from, I have had significant hair thinning over the last two years and they keep checking my thyroid but it seems to check out fine, also I have extreme episodes of all over itching that is VERY intense. The doctor acted as if all these were no big deal and told me to take benadryl. Should I be concerned? Get another opinion? Would the hair loss and itching be linked to the lump and high lymphocytes? I would appreciate your time and reply so I can have an educated idea on what I should do next.

This returned as normal for Chest and Abdo but mentions 'a few morphologically normal lymph nodes in

It's my understanding that the morphologically normal reference means that 
the shape and form is normal. Is the fact that they enhanced on CT of any relevance here.   I don't see my

                I have been having ongoing issues for almost 3 years, but more of my symptoms for longer.  Most of this started after my dh was hospitalized for an unknown infection and I was extremely stressed out.  My youngest son also started school that year and I was at home alone for the first time since having kids.  I started with headaches and dizziness (the dizziness I have had on and off for a few years) while painting my son's room.  I am currently waiting on test results for Radon for his room due to him having fatigue and headaches, something I also deal with.  After that, I started getting bee sting type pains in various body parts as well as breast pain, which an U/S revealed nothing.  At this time, my right arm also felt like it was swollen.  I paint with my R arm and I was also getting shoulder pain and pinched nerve type feeling and extremely tight muscles on that side of my  body.  I have a history of TMJ as a teenager, but that was taken care of.  I tend to clench my jaws, especially when nervous or worked up.  At this time, I was also extremely tired and falling asleep around 7:30 at night, but not waking up refreshed.  Had some abdominal pain with diahrea and constipation.  I also had extreme back, hip, shoulder, and chest and rib pain as well as burning muscle pain.  In February or March of 2011, I had swelling of my submandibular glands and a red, flat rash that itched on my neck and chin.  Went to my internist (who I no longer see because he wanted to push anti-depressants on me and never even once touched me to check glands or anything) and he prescribed antifungal/steroid cream.  Didn't help, but eventually it went away.  I lost a little weight at this time, but gained it all back, plus some.  Things were okay for the most part, but I still had muscle and joint pain and headaches and sometimes stomach aches. 

 I had a lot of bloodwork done this past January and here are the things that came up:  Low Vitamin D (17), slightly low iron, and B12.  High Cholesterol at 217, and my lymph % and # have been consistently low (around 13 and normal is 18 for our lab, I think, I can't find my papers).  I was also tested for Lyme, which the initial screening was positive, but only one band came back on the second test.  I have also had abdominal pain in the URQ, between my ribs and belly button, for the most part, but it sometimes it goes down towards my hip.  Sometimes I can feel a tender lump, but other times it feels like a crampy type pain.  Once in a while I get the cramp pain near my groin, but I have had that on and off since being pregnant with my second son.

I did have  chest Xray in February when I went to the ER for a panic attack.  I laid down that night and felt like I wasn't going to wake up.  The Xray was clear and he gave my Xanax, which I have only taken a few of when  I needed them.  I played volleyball with my son and felt good for the most part.  The end of April I started with the swelling of the salivary glands again as well as extreme upper abdominal pain and bloating.  Had an U/S of the URQ and it was clear.  It was also extremely tender at that time.  I had my son to the PA for something else and showed her my rash and the glands,  She said autoimmune and wanted me to see a Rheumy.  I haven't made that appt yet and my glands seem to be going down at the moment.  I did see a nutrtitionist who did a Bio Feedback scan and a few things came up on there.  I am taking supplements and waiting a few more days to see if that helps.  Babesia came up on that scan, so not sure if I should get checked on that.  I do have all over body itching, sometimes deep in my muscles and bones (mainly shins). It feels like bugs crawling all over me. I also get an itchy scalp and sores on my head.  I have a history of allergies to cats and pollen.  Yesterday I went out to feed my goats and reached under the gate to get some foods and ended up itchy and burning and developed welts on my arms.    

Sorry for rambling, but I am worried that I have had cancer for 3 years and no one has detected it.  I have had joint and muscle pain for quite sometime (been married for 14 years and lived in this house for 14 years, so not sure if radon could be the problem).  I don't get sick but maybe 2 times a year and my colds only last 2-3 days.  I have been having mild night sweats, but not drenching.  No fever, in fact, my temp usually runs a bit low.  My rash seems to come out during temperature changes or when I am worked up.  I also experience odd brusing on my abdomen and legs at times.  I have recently given up gluten and most dairy to see if that would help with abdominal pain and it has decreased my bloating and somewhat the abdominal pain.  I also should say that I had an u/s on my ovaries 2 years ago and that was clear as well.  Thank you for taking your time to read.  Not sure where I should go from here though.

Last year I found out the my spleen was enlarged, but they could not find a reason. On May 23rd, while having a different sonogram, they found out that I had nodules on my thyroid. During a more detailed sonogram on my thyroid it showed that my lymph nodes were enlarged also. I have not been sick lately. All blood work come back normal except for my B12 and Vit D. I had a CT scan with contract June 14th and a FNA on the largest nodule on June 25th. Was also wondering why they are only doing the one asperation and not any of the others? Below is my sonogram results. Was wondering if anyone else had the same issues. When I research all three it points to thyroid cancer or lymphoma. 

A complex mass is seen involving the superior pole of the right lobe measuring 4cm in greatest dimension.  This contains areas of cystic change. Hypoechoic mass is seen involving inferior pole of the right lobe measuring 16mm. No microcalcifications are appreciated. Three nodules are seen on the left. In the midportion a 13mm solid nodule is seen. In the inferior pole a 3mm cyst is seen. Also in the inferior pole a 6mm hypoechoic solid nodule is seen. Regional cervical lymph nodes are seen bilaterally with the largest measuring 2.3cm on the right and 1.9am on the left. The right lobe of the thyroid measures 6.8x3x3.4cm and the left lobe of the thyroid measures 3.7x1.5x1.5cm.

                I have been sick 7 times this year, all with the same symptoms; fevers, night sweats, neck pain/stiffness, nausea/vomiting, severe headache when i bend down or stand up. I went to the doctor, took some blood test and showed that I'm anemic. I've never been anemic. He also said my white blood cell (WBC) count was too high and my red blood cell count being to low. My infection level were 13% higher than its supposed to be.He could never find out why I have so many occurrences of my illness and why I became anemic. I first thought I had spinal meningitis, because of all the headaches, confusion, stiff neck and fevers. But my recent episodes, the 6th and 7th time, there were some new symptoms. I woke up one morning with a nosebleed, didn't know how and why. In all episodes, I also experienced fatigue, tiredness, and sometimes found myself tumbling to regain balance. I've had shortness of breath, had my abdomen swell largely once and had no clue; I wasn't digesting correctly because it took me almost two days to have a bowel movement. 

I have looked at countless websites about leukemia and their symptoms, all in which my symptoms check out. I have yet another blood test with the infectious disease department in a couple of days, but the thought of having leukemia is killing me. The symptoms match but I want to hear it from someone else because it could really be all in my head and I'm over reacting ( I hope I am ).

                HI,
I am writing because I had a CT scan that showed a localized area of swollen lymph nodes in the abdominal area of the superior celiac axis.  My doctor decided to do a wait and see and rescan in 6 months.  SO it's been 6 months and there has been no change.  They is still the small mass that hasn't gotten bigger or smaller.  I have had several abdominal surgeries and have a lot of adhesions and my surgeon doesn't want to cause any more by going in to investigate and biopsy, and says not to worry about it and that it.  SO really my question is should I be ok with letting things sit, and not take this to another doctor to make sure things aren't anything serious?  If it was just an infection wouldn't it had decreased or something over six months.  
 Any advice is welcome, thank-you in advance!

                Hi everybody,

so, I went to the doctor first about chest pain. This has all been checked out now (blood test & X-ray) and everything is normal. The chest pain is still there, they think it is costochondritis (inflammation of the tissue between the ribs). The weird thing is I also have sore lymph nodes in my throat, but they're not swollen. They hurt at random times, often after I drink alcohol. I've had all this for ~6 months now. The doctor mostly focused on the chest pain, but even though the lymph nodes are not excessively painful, it bothers me. Also, my shoulders and neck hurt in general, like a hardening of the muscles. I read about Hodgkin's lymphoma and I was wondering if that could also explain the chest pain, it is mostly around my breasts (I'm a 23 female, by the way) and only hurts when I press on it. I would appreciate any advice and information. Cheers!

I have one dime sized one behind my ear, two small pea sized ones behind my other ear, a very moveable bean sized one in my jaw, and two small ones (moveable) in my groin....Anyways, I went to the doctors freaking out thinking I had lymphoma. My doctor checked my swollen lymph nodes and explained to me they felt completely normal. She also said if they haven;t grown it is also a good sign. I got a blood test just for safety and that came back completely normal.. even though blood tests can't rule out lymphoma, only a biopsy can. Anyways, I have took this to the next level and it is all I think about. I go to the doctors A LOT. And I find myself convincing me that I have lymphoma. I am scheduled to see a psychiatrist in 2 days for my anxiety/hypchondria. But lately I have been having symptoms.. I have beem very fatigued but I can't tell if I really am fatigued or psyching myself out and creating the symptoms. And also, once in a while I will get chest pains but I don't know if that is because I run long distance for my track team or what it is but the chest pains come and go. The main symptom is fatigue that won't go away. I took lexapro but my doctors took me off of that thinking that was the reason. Anyways, I just wanted a second opinon if you think it could be lymphoma or not. I just can't even function a normal life anymore because i'm so worried. Please help!

I've had a small lump in my cheek for about two years now. It's about the size of a pea and seems to swell when I get a cold. It is moveable and reasonably hard. I had assumed it was a lymph node, but am now unsure. I also often have night sweats.

                So a little back ground. Im 30 male about 140 pounds and overall healthy, non-smoker. I take synthroid everyday for hashimotos and T4 levels are normal. I got my blood test results back from a routine physical that I get yearly and had my WBC and RBC values out of range. WBC count was 3.3 and hemoglobin 17.8 with a hematocrit of 52. All other break downs for WBC was within ranges. After asking him to pull up my records to see if the numbers had changed at all he discovered that over the past 3 years my hematocrit and hemo have gone up every year and WBC has decreased every year and promptly sent me to a hematologist. 

The hematologist said she was very concerned and ordered a jak2 test another cbc, ferritin test, abdominal ultrasound and bone marrow biopsy. The jak2 test came back negative, ferritin was normal, and cbc changed very little. Ultrasound came back clean. She is still proceeding with the bone marrow biopsy scheduled next month. 

She believes it is bone related but would not elaborate. From my understanding anything bone and blood related is very serious. With JAK2 making PV very unlikely what could be the other conditions that would make my WBC count continue to drop and hematocrit and hemoglobin continue to rise over a three year period?? I have read that leukemia is usually high white but can also be low white with high red. Thanks for any responses.

Also have been very tired the last few months and have regular headaches and sweat a lot.

I think that the lymphoma has recurred due to beginning to have the same symptoms again (severe fatigue, swollen and painful lymph nodes in the same places).  I am scheduled for a CAT scan on Wednesday.  I had six R-CHOP treatments and then the radiation on the lymph nodes that had not resolved.  Any idea what my options are now?  I have Large B Cell Lymphoma and Follicular is suspected.

                Hi, well for a while Ive had swollen groin lymph nodes and about a month ago now I had one removed for a biopsy, which came back benign fortunately. Ive been taking care of myself and been getting back into my gym schedule but within the last week ive been having odd pain near where the node was removed. Its not the nodes hurting though, its the lymph vessels and they are hardened. For a couple weeks after the node was removed, it was hurting quite a bit and filling with fluid but its slowly gone away as the doctor said it would. Now the pains are like a really bad bruise, only certain movements and pressure cause pain. The area the hurts extends from the front of my leg/groin around to the side of my leg/rear. Im fairly confident that it is a lymph vessel because of the location and how similar it feels to when my biopsy was swollen. Just was wondering if this is normal or if anyone else has had a similar issue after a lymph node removal.

                Hello,

I'm not sure if this is the right place to ask this but Dr. Google is not helping me.  My son had blood allergy testing at 13 months and came back with high wbc, his allergist thought it was odd but he had just gotten over a ear infection so we thought that could be why.  We repeated the blood work a month later after he had shown no signs of illness and his wbc had come down but was still a little high, but his lymphocytes had increased and his neutrophiles had decreased.  I'm trying to find what this could indicate.  He also has a very swollen lymph node on the base of his skull and when I talk him to the peditricition she said there were a few more slightly swollen in his neck and groin.  She talked to a pedi hematoogist and they are just having us wait and retest later this month to see what happens but I'm freaking out. 

I can't find what ranges we should panic.  At 13 months his lympocytes were 64% and at 14 months 74% (normal 40-65) and his neutraphiles were 10.9 and then 10.5(normal 1.6-7.8).  

Does anyone know about this or where I can find more info?

Thanks!

In December 2012 my wbc came back normal at 9.50 but borderline high lymphocytes 
In January 2013 my wbc came back again abnormal at 11.80 with normal neutrophils but high lymphocytes (4.60)!
A month ago my wbc came back normal at 9.40 with normal neutrophils (4.70) but high lymphocytes (3.95)
A week ago my wbc came back abnormal again at 15.90 with high neutrophils (11.30) normal lymphocytes (3.20)
high monocytes (1.15) and normal Immature Granulocytes (0.02). Note that i had a toothache and that was followed by a root canal treatment 2 days before bloodwork.

                Two years ago I started a medication that ""in rare cases lymphoma has occurred"".  Shortly after I started the med I started bruising easily an my hair fell out in clumps.  I also got a weird chest pain that felt like a bubble was in the rear of my chest.  I stopped the med, the bruising stopped and slowly my hair stopped falling out, but the chest pain only continued.  My heart started skipping beats especially when I would bend over.  After a year of complaining and acid reflux and gallbladder issues were ruled out, I had an Eco-cardiogram which came back normal.  I began having unexplained weight loss (currently 93 lbs/ 25 lbs underweight) with no change in diet and exercise.  I began having severe upper back and back of the neck pain that is not muscular nor joint related.  I also had a multitude of other weird symptoms and was finally diagnosed with Hashimoto's via antibody tests.  However, the swelling of the lymph nodes in the back of my neck, right occipital, and both axiallary nodes continued to enlarge.  The are not tender to the touch, but the overall inflammation is extremely painful.  My CBC is normal, though always high RDW (not anemic), with only thyroid antibodies, mildly high blood calcium, and fluctuating bilirubin levels.  Oh and I always have protein spilling in my urine.  The neck and chest pain can get excruciating and antiinflamatory meds don't touch it.  I can feel the nodes knotted in the back of my neck and the axiallries were recently measured by US as 2.5 cm, though ct scan showed it as shotty adenopathy (along with the back of my neck).  My doctor said that the axiallary node is large enough that he scheduled a lymphectomy.  My father died at the age of 52 of mediastinal germ cell cancer and my aunt just lost a battle with breast cancer and subsequent lymphoma.  Ct scan also showed chronic sinusitis and I have had unrelenting drainage and sinus pressure that does not resolve with antibiotics.  Aside from Hashimoto's, I tested positive for a Lyme antibody band and am currently being treated with antibiotics.  Also, I feel the need to mention that during this 2 year time span, I was pregnant and oddly (3 previous healthy deliveries) hemorrhaged severely due to blot clots and required 2 blood transfusions.  I was never given an explanation.
Any information of what my history reveals to you, what I should expect with my lymphectomy, and how to calm my fears while I wait would be greatly appreciated!!!   I trust patients more tha I do doctors these days, so your opinions mean the world to me!

These FISH studies detected multiple abnormalities in interphase nuclei including an extra cope of the IGH signal at 14q32, gain of MAF signal, and gain of TP53 signal.

Is a gain of TP53 signal does that mean a deletion? If there is a gain of signal is that the same as deletion 17p? 
Does MAF = 16q23?  Is a gain of signal good or does signal detected many it is present and bad? 

If the abnormalities are only found in a maximum of 11.5% of cells does that improve the negative overall prognostic or does simply having them determine prognosis independent of the quantity found?

                I am 18/Male/Hispanic. In late 2011, I discovered a grape size, rock-hard, moveable lymph node in my neck. It was deep inside the neck and hard to find at times. Since then, it has not grown or decreased in size. I've had three full CBC tests in the past year and half (January 12', June 12' and January 13') and they have all come back normal. 

This January, I also had a chest x-ray done, and it also came back normal. However, I cannot get over the fact that I have lymphoma. I do not drink whatsoever, but when I tried a sip of alcohol last year, my muscles started to ache. Additionally, I started becoming itchy recently. I have not had any ""B Symptoms"" at all. No weight loss, fever, chills, night sweats, shortness of breath. I've actually gained weight and started eating more healthy. 

I'm not sure what to believe. If my doctor did not seem concerned about my lymph node and did not see any signs in the chest x-ray, could that mean that, if I do have cancer, it could be in its early stages?

what about the three normal CBC's, are those good news?

The one on near the jaw is about 1.2cm im size and the one near the throat is .3 cm in size. My question is is it normal for a swollen lymph node to make one side of my next look bigger and swollen like and bulgy? my next itself is not swollen or have any symptoms of being swollen. Ive just always wondered why it looks swollen is it normal for the lymoh nodes to do that?

This community is here to help you along your journey after diagnosis, or help you understand what questions you may want to ask if you think you may have either.

Please keep in mind that I'm not a doctor, and I have health issues of my own, so I may not be able to reply right away. I will do my very best to help in whatever capacity I am able. While I don't have either, I am knowledgable with both and when I don't have an answer, I will search for you.

If you haven't already, please check out the Health Pages

There are also some great trackers available!

This link has CBC, Pain and Chemotherapy Trackers. These can be valuable tools when working with different doctors and to help you keep track of things! 

My mother is not only a breast cancer survivor, but she also has Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia and I just lost a cousin on my fathers side in July 2008 to either ALL or AML. (My aunt doesn't know) but it was very aggressive. 

These have made me interested in both leukemia and lymphoma, since my mother having CLL puts me and my sister at a higher risk of lymphoma. 

If your post gets pushed to the second page before I or anyone else has had a chance to respond, feel free to reply to your post with the word ""bump"" or a question such as ""anyone?"" This will post it back to the first page and give me a chance to see it!

                I got my lab results back and my WBC's all came back on the lower end of the ""normal"" range but my lymphocyte count was at 41.4% (normal lab is 20%-40%) What does this mean?? I don't think it's a viral infection because I have felt fine (no fever, etc).

user_523927,ott70,/posts/Leukemia-and-Lymphoma-/Lymph-Node-Confusion/show/635763,Lymph Node Confusion,"
                So I'm pretty confused about what's a normal lymph node and what's not. The more I read about them and people's opinions, I can't really make heads or tails over what's a problem and what's not.

The only bit of info that seems real consistent is if you have a node that keeps growing then you need to get it checked out.

I have read that Dr. Paul or Dennis comment that lymphoma can exist in any size lymph node, which I would agree has to be true since it has to start somewhere. However, that means everyone could have lymphoma if it exists in any lymph size. Since I don't hear about people getting their nodes biopsied all of the time, I assume their must be some type of criteria doctors use to make a diagnosis for further evaluation.

Hard lymph nodes are supposed to be a warning sign also, but what I think could be hard has been verified by doctors as not hard. I guess a bad node would feel like a rock?

So what seems medically inconsistent to me is:
- Lymph sizes, unless abnormally large.
- Lymph nodes being tender or not. I've had nodes that haven't caused any pain and nodes that have caused pain, but it doesn't seem that either is consistent with a warning sign.
- Lymph locations, maybe it's worse to have swelled lymphs in one area versus another?
- Lymph pain without any swelling. I'll get this in my armpits sometimes and possibly the groin.
- Rubbing on your nodes causes them to stay big?
- If you have had a large node for a year or longer, but it hasn't increased in size then it's probably not of a concern? Or a node that swells and shrinks and swells and shrinks is probably just the node doing its job?

I would like to trust my medical doctors but it seems like they will only take interest if I have a Godzilla growth going on. It seems that lymph node testing would be the basic function of a medical doctor, so generally all doctors should be trained and have an idea when a node doesn't feel correct, right?

What about methods of testing to find out if a node is indeed enlarged? For example, I think I have some swelling in my groin area, but it's not pronounced enough to call it the size of a grape or something like that. To avoid unnecessary radiation, would a pelvic ultrasound show the size of a lymph node in the pelvic region? How about an MRI for checking out nodes?

And history about myself is elevated EBV titers for the last 7 months and a slightly enlarged spleen found two months ago. All kinds of various symptoms, which I have presented to my doctors on numerous occasions, but these two have been the most major findings from all of my testing. Occasional low lymphocytes from CBC tests, but my last CBC has the level back up in the acceptable range. I was under the impression that swollen nodes from EBV would be tender and painful, but mine are not always that way. Or maybe my nodes are done with the infection but now they need time to recover and shrink back down?

Confusion, I tell you. Thanks for any comments.

                Hi!

I am 25 years old girl. A week before I notice a little bump in my groin. I am quite sure it is a swollen lymph node. It is 2cm x 0.6 cm in size. In some position you almost can not see if you dont touch the area. It is very mobile, and firm but not very hard. It is painless.

The thing is that a week before notice this bump, I have some irritation in the area, because I was wearing very tight underwear for several days /weeks. Also I shaved the area few days before noticing the bump.

In a week the bump doesn't seem to shrink significantly. Should I be worried or should I wait more? As I were quite worried I was touching the bump a lot.

Could this be a shotty node? How long does it need to shrink? This could be consider as normal?

THANK YOU SO MUCH

                Hi. I'm not sure if I am posting in the correct forum or not, but I have been having back pain for the past month and I know someone who was diagnosed with Leukemia and his main symptom was lower back pain.

Like I said, for the past month I have been having lower back pain. I have tried heating pads and using pillows as support when laying down and nothing seems to make it better. It hasn't gotten any worse which I dont know is a good or bad thing. It seems to be in the area of the tailbone. I get frequent allergies which cause alot of sneezing for about a 24 hr period at a time, so at first I thought I had sneezed so hard that I had pulled something but it hasnt gotten better since. I also recently left a job I was at for about 4 years where I would be standing on my feet anywhere from 5-9 hrs a day, 5 days a week. The pain didnt start until I had left the job, so I thought maybe my back was becoming tightened from less movement. I am also a frequent back cracker, and since this pain has started, I haven't been able to crack back as often, sometimes not at all. Is there a connection with that?

Either way, a simple visit to the doctor would be an automatic suggestion but I'm sure I would be sent for testing and my insurance won't cover anything at this time.  So I am here to see if there are any suggestions as to what this could be. Thankfully, I have no other symptoms that I have read leukemia brings.

Thanks.

I also have big swelling behind knees (in soft part), by my elbows and groin for last 4 weeks. Sometimes a throbing paing goes through it.

                Hello,

I have two lymph nodes under my jaw that I can feel. The one on the left under my jaw feels about the size of a pea. It is moveable and soft. The one on the right feels a little big smaller then a marble. It is moveable as well. I know that I felt the one on the right at least 3 years ago and thought nothing of it. Because I occasionally deal with health anxiety and right now it's flaring up, I have convinced myself that these two swollen submandibular nodes means that I have lymphoma. I do not have any night sweats or fatigue. I have had weight loss but I have been dieting and exercising as well ( I am overweight). I had alot of decay in my teeth in my early to mid 20's that I got corrected when I was 25. I am now 33. Could these nodes have swelled up due to that and never went back down? Are these normal nodes and just palpable? I have read that nodes in this area can sometimes be felt. My dentist also recently told me that I have gigivitis. Could this be causing my two submandibular nodes to feel swollen?

                Hello all.  I'm hoping maybe somone can make me feel a bit better as I am pretty much totally horrified right now.  Back in December, I found a small lump on the left side of my neck.  I went to my general practitioner who sent me for a CT Scan with contrast which revealed that the lump was a 10 mm slightly enlarged lymph node.  The CT Scan said it appeared normal in all other aspects.  My doctor told me to come back once a month for a few months so he could check it and make sure it felt the same but that if I thought it was getting larger to come back sooner because then it may have to be biopsied or be taken out.  Being the hypochondriac and anxiety ridden person that I am, I, of course, feel it every day.  I went back for my one month check up in January and it seemed the same but now it is DEFINITELY feeling bigger to me.  I have my February check up on Saturday and I am so scared that it is cancer because it is getting bigger and it doesn't hurt.  I guess I just have to wait and see and probably will have to have it removed or biopsied.  I am so scared.

                Hi.
I don't even know if I am in the correct forum and I am very confused.
My 9 yr old son has a ovoid hypoechoic lesion  on the left side neck with its own vascularity. Its very painful. He is getting pain in his left shoulder as well.
He is extremely lethargic sleeping up to 12 - 13 hours a night and napping during the day. He doesn't have his usually energy when he is awake. He is having night sweats but no fevers that I have seen.
We have had blood tests done and it came back with a eosinophils level of 1.04 x 10 ^9/l or 18%. 
It also indicated he had had EBV previously. 
There wasn't anything else significant.
My doctor said the eosinophils is probably due to allergies but my son hasn't got any symptoms of allergies other than the eosinophils levels. No rashes, no wheezing.....nothing.
My doctor didn't seem to be able to give me any answers. Should I be concerned? Is everything related or am I looking at 2 separate problems? 
Help please......

                About a month ago I had developed severe constipation. I also around that same time developed a lump feeling in my throat when I swallow. After two weeks I had labs done . Everything came back normal. A week or so later I had my physical. By this time I had been severely constipated for a month + and the lump was still in my throat. I am on a natural 30 day herbal cleanse. I can now have a bowel movement once per day. But it's not loose as it was with laxitives and my stomach isn't as bloated. But I still feel pressure above the navel and around that whole area as though something is there. The lump is gradually getting worse. I have a muscle/bump on the back of my head and the doctor thought originally that was causing the neck lump when I swallow.

Doctor has done an exam , I had cervical soft tissue xrays of my neck yesterday. No results yet. Constipation is better but I know something is not right.

No real fever. I usually run 98 something to 99 at one point in the day. I have no idea if I should demand a stomach ultrasound? A colonoscopy> Are my lymph nodes enlarged due to cancer? How would I know anything is cancer? This week I had two mammograms and an ultrasound. Small cyst or fibroid(?) but tiny and nothing to be concerned with. (or do I push to look harder?)

                I'm a female, 5'5"" 135 lbs, 51 yrs old, I exercise 5-7 days a week and am generally healthy.  A couple of weeks ago, I noticed what I believe are swollen lymph nodes along my inner arms from my forearms to my triceps.  I've never felt my lymph nodes in my arms before, so I'm not entirely sure that's what they are, but some of them feel sort of moveable and soft and a some of them (right above my elbow) are larger and firmer.  They feel about kidney bean sized.  I feel about 5 or 6 in each arm.

I've also been having breathing issues the last few months.  My doctor is treating me for asthma, although my lungs are clear.  My peak flow meter readings should be 475, and my average is 360.  I've been on 3 different inhalers (currently on Azmacort & Proair) and 4 medications (currently on singulair, claritin, omeprazole & ranitidine).  At times I feel as though I'm being strangled, although it isn't as bad as it was a month ago - which is when I started the omeprazole and ranitidine.  I've had a chest xray, ultrasound on my thyroid, blood tests for my thyroid and everything has come up negative.  

Are any of these symptoms related to the swollen lymph glands or is it probably a different issue?  I'll be visiting my doctor in 3-4 weeks as a followup to my asthma treatments, but do you think I should get in to see her sooner?  

Thank you for your response.

                Sometime in late December I noticed a swollen lymph node on neck-jaw. I had a cold so decided to wait. January 29th I visited my doctor who prescribed antibiotics, ordered bloodwork, urine test and sonogram. February 13th went back for results: sonogram (2 large left cervical lymph nodes may require biopsy 14mm & 16mm) blood work was in normal range I will list most items below. My doctor referred me to ENT. I  visited two ENTs both surgeons, first one said he thought it was a tongue muscle which me and my wife explained to him could not be because it was spherical he disregarded it and said I was fine. The second said he ""thought"" it was a salivary gland but ordered a ct scan to be sure. I had no other symptoms until 3 days ago i started having mild tingling (not really itch)all over (I have been extremely anxious and stressed and not sleeping well), I had some chills last night and sweating, I have not lost any weight or had any fevers and right now my lymph nodes are barely noticeable about 30% of wast they were before(i had a little bulge on side of neck) . Can all the symptoms be a coincidence. Why would swelling go down so much and considering the swelling began little over 2 months ago does this help in treatment??

I'm not sure if it went away since then or that I just didn't pay anymore attention to it. But yesterday while shaving I stumbled upon a lump in the same exact area only noticeably larger in size. It is right under the skin and not visible unless felt. There is no pain, however it is in a fixed position and is quite hard. My girlfriend and brother felt it today and was immediately able to feel it without having to search for it. I have not been sick for several months, I am 19, weigh 140lbs and 5'8"".

I'm sure there are several options but after running through an insane amount of blood work and appearing to have no active infections causing reactive nodes, I'm trying to hold on hope that there are options outside of Lymphoma!

This morning inwas shavin my pubic area and I notice it lump when I pressed on it. 

The lump is under the skin and you can't not really see it unless I bend backwards. 

It is on my pubic hair area close to my thigh crease. 
It's is squishy. No pain or discoloration

                After have a slightly elevated WBC for about 2 years my primary sent me to a hematologist. Since my WBC ranged from 18.5 2 years ago and went down to 12 in Dec he didn't think it was anything serious but said he would follow me to make sure. In Jan WBC was still around 12 but he also performed a gene test and said the results were very suspicious. He said I had CML and scheduled a bone marrow biopsy for the following day when my husband could be with me. After 10 days I went back for the results and was told the biopsy came back normal and that I did not have CML. My question is...does the normal biopsy rule out CML all together? Even with the positive gene test (which I believe was positive for the Philadelphia chromosome). Any insight would be appreciated. I was in such shock when he said I didn't have CML I didn't even ask questions and I don't go back for another month and a half.

                I am a 42 year old female, am 5' 10' and weigh 139.  My weight is down about 60 lbs in the last 2 years without trying or doing anything different.  Last year I had a work up which revealed no reason for the weight loss.  Recently, I had a CBC done and my eosinophils were 25.3.  I have no allergies to my knowledge and do not have worms or any reason to believe I am infected with a parasite.  My question is this; what is a reasonable amount of time before I recheck a CBC to find out if the eosinophils have calmed down?  I have other vague symptoms that can all be attributed to other things.  I don't want to overreact and pursue a lengthy and costly workup again.  Leukemia continues to pop up on the differential.

                brief history.  It has now been 7 1/2 weeks of sickness.  Which all started with what I was told the Flu.. I went to the emergency due to a high fever-- sweating, VERY sore chest/ribs.. felt like I was being crushed. and all joints hurt. so the doctor told me it was the flu and gave me some needle in my hip. which he said would relax my body so I could rest. the next day I woke up with a swollen ear and lost my hearing .. i was put on an antibiotic and told I would need tubes. So this carried on for another week, the Amoxicillan (sp) made me worse.. went back and put on three new meds.. drops, pill and pain killer.. now this sickness has not left. a few weeks later... all lymph nodes were swollen, I turned yellow and had more pain on my left side ribs, like I was being crushed.. and hives on my chest and back Went to the walk in. 
Doctor was very concerned. He put me on Pen Vee and told me to get my blood and urine fully tested.. and if it got worse to go back to the ER.. so a few days went by and my family doctor personally called me and told me to come in ASAP.. So I did.. My blood work and a very high white blood count and some abnormalities. he did an exam and said my spleen was enlarged. and asked me about family history with Lymphoma (my uncle is now in remission and cancer is very high in my family) then talked about Leukaemia.... (which scared me) but then also talked about Mono ( I have no sore throat at the time of this question ) .... and told me I need to go for a chest xray and ultrasound plus more blood work (which I am doing tomorrow) he also put me on another pill Cefzil which honestly makes me feel so much more worse (new symptoms with this pill, sore throat bad headaches) my chest honestly feels like someone is sitting on it... or like a pulled all my torso muscles. cough is present but not a hacking more like a little baby cough.  and my eyes are still Reddish yellow.  and if I walk more then 10 steps I cannot breath. also very fast heart rate and i have to lay down

What are my chances of it just being mono and not what he is telling me with the Cancer... anyone go through this. I am 28 years old and scared outta my mind.  7 1/2 weeks or more is a long time to be this sick.  I havent had the night sweats since the flu at the start.. but I do get the hot flashes like I am burning up.. still yellowish pale and flushed in my cheeks... please help

                Often times, people come to this forum to ask about results of blood work they received and if there is any correlation to having a blood cancer.  It’s important to know that blood counts alone can’t determine if you have a blood cancer, but they can alert your doctor if further testing is needed.  Interpreting blood test results is not black and white, as there can be many different reasons for the results you see.  For example, did you know that both high and low lymphocyte levels (a type of white blood cell) can indicate a malignancy?  However, it can also indicate other causes.  This is why it is important that you speak directly with your doctor about your results and not rely strictly on the information you find online.  

That being said, I want to provide a quick reference guide on this forum for those seeking help with interpreting blood test results, particularly their red and white blood cells.  The majority of information provided is from a book called Living with Lymphoma by Elizabeth M. Adler, Ph.D.  It’s an older book published in 2005, but one I highly recommend to someone who is newly diagnosed with Lymphoma.

Factors that can affect white blood cell count:

Neutrophil:
Increased levels (neutrophilia), more than 10,000 cells per microliter  

•Infection: particularly bacterial
•Malignancies: Leukemia (and some others).  Mild to moderate neutrophilia is sometimes present with Hodgkins lymphoma
•Drugs: glucocorticosteroids (may be given as part of some chemo regimens).  Lithium (used to treat some psychiatric conditions), colony-stimulating factors (given to treat chemotherapy-induced neutropenia may cause a neutrophilic “rebound”)

Neutrophil:
Decreased levels (neutropenia), less than 1,500 cells per microliter

•Drugs: many chemotherapy drugs
•Disease: some autoimmune diseases (lupus, rheumatoid arthritis) that may predispose to lymphoma, following some infections
•Vitamin deficiency: Folic acid, B12.
•Lymphoma: direct effect (bone marrow invasion), indirect effect (inhibitory cytokines)

Eosinophil:
Increased levels (eosinophilia), more than 500 cells per microliter

•Allergic responses
•Parasitic infections
•Disease: some autoimmune diseases (lupus, rheumatoid arthritis) that may predispose to lymphoma
•Malignancies: including Hodgkin's lymphoma and some forms of NHL

Eosinophil:
Decreased levels (eosinopenia), less than 50 cells per microliter

•Drugs: glucocorticoid hormones (may be given as part of some chemo regimens)
•Acute stress: including severe bacterial infection
•Cushing syndrome (an endocrine disorder that affects glucocorticoid levels)

Monocyte:
Increased levels (monocytosis), more than 800 cells per microliter

•Infections: tuberculosis, malaria
•Malignancies: leukemia, preleukemic conditions, sometimes lymphoma.

Monocyte: 
Decreased levels (monocytopenia), less than 100 cells per microliter

•Drugs: many chemo drugs, glucocorticoid hormones (may be given as part of some chemotherapy regimens)
•Acute stress: including severe bacterial infection
•Cushing Syndrome (an endocrine disorder that affects glucocorticoid levels)
•Malignancy: some forms of leukemia

Lymphocyte:
Increased levels (lymphocytosis), more than 5,000 cells per microliter

•Malignancies: chronic lymphocytic leukemia, lymphoplasmacytoid lymphoma, splenic lymphoma with villous lymphocytes (splenic marginal zone lymphoma), mild lymphocytosis with other indolent lymphomas and leukemias
•Infection: typhoid, tuberculosis, mononucleosis, early stages of HIV
•Drugs: Dilantin, carbamazepine

Lymphocyte:
Decreased levels (lymphocytopenia), less than 1000 cells per microliter

•Malignancies: lymphoma (mostly Hodgkin's Lymphoma)
•Radiation therapy: may be very prolonged.
•Drugs: certain chemo drugs (fludarabine and cladribine), glucocorticoid hormones (may be given as part of some chemo regimens
•Biological therapies
•AIDS and certain other infections
•Severe malnutrition
•Hereditary

*Note: The above factors include common causes of abnormalities in white cell levels; it is not exhaustive.  


Factors that can affect red blood cells:

Red blood cells, also known as erythrocytes, carry oxygen to all the different cells of the body.  Your hematocrit levels are the percentage of blood composed of red blood cells.  If your hematocrit levels drop below the normal levels, the person is said to be anemic.  This is often caused by loss of blood, suppression of bone marrow by certain drugs, insufficient iron, kidney disease and infiltration of the bone marrow by malignant cells.  Since the total red cell volume determines the hematocrit, either a reduction in the size of individual cells or a decrease in the total number of red cells can cause anemia.  Anemia can occur due to malignancy (Hodgkins and NHL).  Cancerous cells can crowd out normal cells in the bone marrow that were destined to become erythrocytes and cause anemia.

                Hi,
Sorry in advance, this is going to be a long question. 
Back in August I noticed a lump in my groin area and I kept an eye on it for a while but it didn’t seem to go away although it did grow and shrink. By the time I decided I should probably get it checked out it was time for me to move back to school, and so I wasn’t able to get it checked out. The lump was never painful, although at times it had a strange/tender feeling. I spent the whole semester constantly worrying about it and as the semester went on other symptoms appeared (these may or may not have been caused from anxiety and over thinking it) such as a strange feeling in my armpit(s). Im not sure how to describe it besides a strange feeling because it didn’t hurt, it just felt almost as if I had a shirt on that was too small, even when I wasn’t wearing a shirt. I never found any kind of lump in either armpit (which leads me to believe I was only experiencing the feeling because I was afraid the lump in my groin was lymphoma). I also had a lump on/below my earlobe, but this lump would come and go. Towards the end of the semester i noticed I was constantly tired and had a decreased appetite, but I convinced myself it was because I was stressed from school and not sleeping well. I had also lost anywhere from 5-10 pounds, but as I have an incredibly fast metabolism and can lose weight by sitting on a couch eating ice cream I didn’t think much of it at  first. When the semester was over (just after Christmas) I went to my regular doctor about the lump in my groin. I meant to ask about the other symptoms but I figured if I had cancer they would be able to find it from the lump and the other symptoms weren't as tangible. The doctor said he wasn’t worried about it, but just to be sure sent me to a urologist to get it checked out. The urologist again said he wasn’t worried after a physical examination. His explanation was that its normal for lymph nodes to grow (and sometimes stay enlarged) and that it was probably only noticeable because of how skinny I am. After this I put the whole thing out of my mind for a while, until I found a lump in my neck. When I found the lump in my neck I was utterly convinced I had cancer but I had already gone back to school. The lump in my ear (that had been coming and going) moved to more of the back of my ear. When school started to pick up I noticed I was constantly tired, but also ""out of it"" all the time, almost as if I was watching someone else live my life as points.
Other notes: The lump in my neck went away after a couple of weeks, and looking back on it, it was probably just a pimple. Also another reason why I was/am so freaked out is that my dad had lymphoma when he was my age. 
My question is how urgent is it that I go back to the doctors. I know I should go again, if for nothing else but peace of mind, but right now I am at school and can't go to my usual doctor. I'd have to miss school to go to the doctors again, so can I wait a month or so until spring break to go to the doctors? 
My thoughts: I looked up feeling out of It all the time cause this really bothered me, and I found that it can be caused by anxiety (its called depersonalization or something like that) which made be start to think that I really don’t have many tangible symptoms and maybe this could all be in my head? The lingering issues such as the lumps in my groin/ear still have me concerned though. 
Thanks for any feedback!

I have been having horrible joint and bone pain and off and on cold like issues since b4 thanksgiving with just a cough. my gp wanted me to have my thyroid dr do labs for inflammatory things like RA or lupus. 
I just so happened to get hurt at work and was in for a hand x-ray and the dr there was asking about my joint pain and my other autoimmune things and gave me some good info on a dr to do test for that.. so when I had to go back for a recheck of my had he asked how I felt with everything else I told him the same just dont feel right.. he felt the node in my neck and said it was 2cm, when I told him what gp said he said and that it was only 1cm 2 weeks ago he said I need a scan done ASAP and that something is going on and I need to find/have dr that will find out what it is.

                Just over a month ago I had many tender swollen lymph nodes inside my labia which then spread to my groin. There was no obvious cause the doctor thought maybe some type of cellulitis and prescribed antibiotics. The initial nodes have subsided but there is still some slight swelling and discomfort in my groin which send a deep achy pain down the inside of my thigh. A pelvic ultra sound confirmed enlarged lymph nodes and noted sizes and benign appearance. A CBC with diff was normal WBC was on the low side of normal range.  A few days later I caught a cold or flu. A few days after that, I had a very painful swollen node in my arm pit. I assumed from the illness. I have been over the flu for 10 days or so. For the past 3 weeks I have continued to have swelling in different nodes in both arm pits. Nodes subside after few days and a new one seems to swell. A new came on last night with visible redness and swelling on the surface. It hurts my whole arm and hurts to wear a bra.  I also have an enlarged periauricular node just in front of my left ear this does not feel super tender like the others but had radiating pressure type pain into my temple area. All swollen nodes feel moveable. I am waiting to see the doctor next week. What is going on? What would cause the swelling of nodes throughout these different areas of the body? Is it possible to have lymphoma with normal CBC results? What should I ask the doctor?

                For the past 3 months I have had swollen lymph nodes in my neck. I went to the doctor and they put me on amoxicillion 2 times a day for two weeks because my doctor thought I had tonsil stones. When that didnt seem to work I went back in and they tested me for mono my test came back negative but I was give a steroid to help with my swollen lymph nodes since it was hard for me to eat and the constant feeling of something being stuck in my throat. That worked for the 3 days that I was supposed to take it. A couple days later I started having the feeling of something stuck in my throat and still swollen lymph nodes. I went back to the doctor she told me I had mono and said that it just doesnt show up on blood work all the time. She ordered another blood test which came back negative again for mono and everything else was normal. I went back to eating fine and then the something stuck in my throat came back and then went away and is now back again which stops me from eating regular food. I have lost weight from not eating so she gave me the same steroids again so that it would bring the swelling in my lymph nodes down and so I could eat but it didnt even work. Now I have times where I get shortens of breath and I always seem to be spitting up phlem expecillay after I drink or eat anything. Im going to be going to get a biopsy of my lymph node under my armpit to see if it cancer but its just a biopsy with a needle. Is there any other tests that I should ask my doctor to schedule? Has anyone else had any similar symptoms?

                So while we wait to see if the state provided insurance is going to approve a specialist. My mind wonders. Clark has always been on the lean side with very little body fat. He has gotten sick very easy and has been on and off antibotic's since he was little. Then suddenly about 2 weeks ago he starts running a very high fever and his tummy hurt and no other symptoms, we thought it could be his appendix took him to the dr and no it wasn't his  appendix, it wasn't strep nor the onset of the flu. They gave him a shot and he got better for a couple days. ( in the past now that we have thought about it and chalked it up to cutting teeth he did run a random high fever no symptoms and it would go away about as quick as it came) then 3days later its starts back and so he goes back to the dr and his ear is congested they started him on antibotics, doesn't help all weekend he is still feeling poorly, so I take him to the dr first thing Monday and they do a quick CBC which was fine so they decide to do blood work for infectious mono, because he had rapidly lost 4lb over the weekend and had stopped eating and was showing ketones in  his urnine, the results came back that he did NOT have Mono, but they want to send him to a hematologist at the childrens hopsital, Due to what did come back. Here are his results:

                I recently went to the ER because my left armpit was swollen. Dr diagnosed it as a Lipoma and sent me home. Hours later, I developed a small bump on my neck and since then my armpit, neck, collar bone, and wrist have remained swollen (all on the left side). I wouldn't consider any of it painful, however my shoulder and wrist get very stiff and a bit uncomfortable. After googling it, my non-physician self, concluded maybe it's an infection in my lymph nodes. The Dr didn't examine any lymph nodes, solely focused on my armpit.

                My last bloodwork, my WBC was 10.9. ANC, or Neur ABS, was 6.53, & my TSH was 8.91. My anion gap was only 4. I asked my doctor to take another blood test, & he said they didnt check it, cas i had a cup of coffee? I know he checked it but wont tell me? His nurse said my prostate bloodwork was normal, & 20 miniutes before i had my urolist say my enlarged prostate was getting worse!(different hospital) So other question is would my bloodwork for enlarge prostate come back normal, even if i was still holding back 25 percent pee? My father had leukemia also. I dont know what is going on, since my brain bleed. If i was well, & didnt own this apt. house, & felt better, i would move out of state, & get another health care. I have cardiac disease, thyroid(low) enlarge prostate,& caught epiglititis a few years ago which was so bad they put me in ICU. Could not swallow anymore, even water, it would come up my nose! Doctor never saw it so bad. I lasted 29 days, with oxygin, & pain patch that didnt help my throat. Anyway, i am very concerned about the high blood counts, & what they mean? thank u!

                I have had extremely swollen lymph nodes in my neck below my jaw and on my jaw bone for about 4 weeks. I put it off as an infection for about 2 weeks and the swelling went down some but they were still swollen and tender. I drank alcohol on Thursday and Friday morning I woke up with them being extremely swollen again, by extremely swolllen I mean that you can see them bulging out of my neck. I have also had unexplained fatigue, ""hot flashes"" at night time to where I feel feverish because I am sweating, but have no fever and I have lost 15 lbs in the last two weeks. I went to an immediate care where they ran a CBC blood test and a mono and strep test... Everything came back negative and my CBC came back normal, my white blood count is not elevated, meaning I do not have an infection which is typically the cause of swollen glands. I have an appointment tomorrow with my GP but I am a little worried because the Nurse Practitioner who took care of me yesterday seemed really concerned when she saw my lymph nodes and immediately said, ""They're huge!"" when she felt them and requested that I see my GP and get a biopsy this week. I know you can't diagnose without a biopsy, but Im wondering if it could be something else??? I know a lot of people have swollen glands for years and drs don't know why, but how swollen are they exactly?? Are they just slightly swollen or swollen enough to narrow the passageway in your throat and bulge out of your neck?

                I am a 28 yr old female, I was just in the er with a fever(around 100) and a severe headache. While I was there They found out that I had a UTI, and that I had low wbc's (which was called nuetropenia on the discharge paperwork). I just had a baby 8 mo ago and I know my blookwork was normal then. I have also had a load of stress, I lost my father suddenly 3 months ago, I go to school full time, and have two little ones. I am generally a very worried person....and I know I have a poor diet. That being said when the (not so compasionate) er doctor told me to follow up with a general practice to get my cbc's rechecked in a week to rule out  luekemia.....I was a bit alarmed to say the least.well that was a day 1/2 ago, and with the antibiotics I have received, tonight I fell 100 percent better. Should I be worried about this nuetropenia? (I don't have the exact numbers, should have thought to ask for them)

                I am concerned about some swelling I have had in my right supraclavicular area for about 16 months now.  The area is very painful and to the point of debilitaing at times.  It causes me pain in the right side of my neck all the way around to the back of my scalp, my right shoulder joint, and down the right side of my chest wall.  In August of 2011 I had swelling in the lymph nodes under my right arm to the point that I could not put my arm down comfortably.  I was diagnosed in September 2011 with Lupus after blood work (positive ANA w/ speckled pattern) and my symptoms were all put together (body pain all over, swollen painful joints, swollen lymph nodes).  I was put on three anitibotics that did not help, then placed on prednisone for three months and in December started taking Plaquenil.  After the Plaquenil the swelling under my arm went down.  However, the lump in my shoulder has not.  It causes a burning sensation in the muscle on the back of my shoulder also.  I do not have weight loss (just the opposite actually, I have gained a lot), not night sweats except when I was on Prednisone, but they stopped and were not ""drenching"" night sweats.  No fever that I am aware of unless I am sick.  The pain in this area and the egg size (and shaped) mass are what worry me.  I am terrified of a diagnosis of cancer.  I have lower back pain also, it seems to come from my spine out toward my hips and sometimes from my hips down my legs.  I was told in a CT scan that I had some deterioration in this area also and I know the Lupus can affect my hip joints.  I am just concerned.  My Dr did a MRI earlier in 2012 that said I had a 1 cm reacitve lymph node in my shoulder.  He then sent me for a CT scan that said the node was not visible at that time, but did say I had a ""mildly"" enlarged heart (I do have HBP and aorticinsufficiency not sure if that might be why), and deterioration in my lower spine area.  I do not doubt the Lupus diagnosis because I have some pretty classic symptoms.  I am just worried about a cancer diagnosiss and cant seem to get anyone to do a biopsy.  They keep telling me my blood work looks fine, my scans did not show any masses, I have since had chest xrays that came back normal.  Should I stop worrying, because it still is swollen and painful.  Not growing that I can tell, same as it always was.  Sometimes hard and painful, other times rubbery and painful.  Always painful.  Any input would be appreciated.  Thanks.

                Hello~

I normally post on the Thyroid Forum but have been having symptoms lately that don't seem to be related to the Thyroid.

Here goes....

The symptom that is bothering me the most is a feeling of breathlessness in my chest along with the feeling sometimes that I have swallowed something.  Also, it feels like I have bronchitis without the fever and coughing. (although I have been noticing that I am coughing more lately)  I am losing stamina when I exercise to the point of feeling like I am going to pass out if I push myself too hard (this seems to be progressively getting worse). I have had a couple of nights where I have woken up sweatier than normal, didn't have to change clothes or the bed sheets but was definitely sweaty). I feel feverish sometimes but have yet to take my temp.  I have noticed a rash under my right armpit that itches but I abstain from scratching, I do seem to have some sort of rash/eczema at the back of my neck. I don't have any swollen lymph nodes that I can feel, just concerned about the chest thing, but do have pain in my neck that wakes me up sometimes.  

I had a CT scan of my throat last week but doc won't be in till tomorrow/appt is on Thursday.  He told me in November that he would do an Xray of my chest but didn't think he would find anything.  I'm not sure why he ordered the CT of my throat other than my feeling that something was stuck.  I wanted to have something done before the end of the year for insurance reasons since I wasn't feeling any better since I saw him in November.  I basically feel pretty crappy most of the time. I've lost some weight lately, not sure how much.

One last thing that is going to sound very strange, I have been waking up in the night, quite often, with the feeling that something is shaking internally from my head through my torso.  No outward appearance of this symptom whatsoever.  This has been happening for a few years, but last night was exceptionally noticeable. It actually wakes me up.

I can't sleep with the worry about what is wrong with me and The Google doesn't help either:)

Thanks so much for your time.

                 Hi,Sorry if this post ends up being long...In Jan i noticed when i got up i would get dizzy and get short of breath then in March my thighs had a dull ache.I went to the Dr and found out i was 2 mths pregnant.They ran blood test on me and all came back normal except my Anti Hcv test it came back positive.So i had to go to a gastronologist (sp?) to get my liver checked and he told me he wasnt for sure if i even had hep c because he said pregnant women produce all kinds of antibodys.So he ran another anti hcv test,and the other test for the hep c he also ran a liver panel and test for hep b as well.He also felt to see if my liver and spleen where swollen (which they were not).2 weeks later i get the call and all that blood work was normal.During my pregnancy i experienced alot.I walked my kids to the bus stop and starting bleeding bad and i thought for sure i was miscarrying.I went to the ER scared and crying and when they checked her heartbeat it was strong ( i was so relieved).But the ultrasound tech said she saw something that looked like a tear on my uterus.I went to my obgyn and they did an ultrasound and said i had a fibroid and that caused be to bleed like that.In June i threw my back out.Fast forward to Aug and my water started leaking 2 and a half months early and i was put in the hospital and they ran all kinds of blood tests again and also ran another anit hcv test to make sure.They told me all my bloodwork was normal and my anti hcv test was neg this time.I asked him what could have caused it to be positive the first time and he said either lab error or it got crossed up with some other protein.I was in the hospital being monitored for 2 weeks when i end up going in to labor having her Aug 15.I still was having the dull ache in my thighs but after i gave birth to her my rash went away.But a few weeks later i would get stinging sensations through out my body.I noticed that during my pregnancy and even now after ive had her i sweat alot even at not but not drenching where i would have to change sheets and clothes,i get random brusies,my thighs still ache but if i apply pressure to them it relieves the pain,my fingers get tingle,my elbows and knees ache although not every day,I get headaches that come and go but headaches run in my family so does diabetes and rheumatoid arthritis.I also get short of breath,And have back pain.Since august ive had 2 uti's and i also just got over a bad stomach virus that was going around.Ive notice i bruise easier ever since i had gotten pregnant and i get random bruises even now when im not pregnant.

I also want to mention before i got pregnant i lost 94lbs but i use to weigh 298 and i was exercising for 2 hrs a day 6 days a week and drunk nothing but water or a small cup of orange juice and cut out all the junk food and at lots of veggies and fruits.But when i got pregnant my weight shot up fast now im 255.The bruising,thigh pain,elbow and knee pain really scare me.I've had so many CBC's,CMP's and they have always came back normal except 3 times when my wbc were slightly elevated because of my uti's and right before i gave birth which i believed i had an uti then to because of my water constantly leaking.Idk what to what could be going on with me but whe you research online for bruising and joint pain first thing that pops up is leukemia.Please dont think im stupid im just wondering if anyone else has my symptoms and could it possibly be leukemia.

                I have some conerns about my blood work. I had blood work done is September and I had several things be flagged. 

WBC 3.5
RBC4.26
Hemoglobin 12.0
Hematocrit 37.1 %
MCV 87
MCH 28.2
MCHC 32.3 
RDW 14.4 %
Platelets 236
Neutrophils 62 %
Lymps 27%
Netrophils absolute 2.2 
Lymps 0.9
Vitamin b 12 192
Ferritin 6
vitamin d 26.7

Out of those results it flagged my WBC, Vitamin b 12, Vitamin d and Ferritin. My gyno put me on multi vitamins and I had another blood test done on 10/31/12 here are some of those results.

WBC 3.0
RBC 4.42
Hemoglobin 12.9
Hematocrit 38.1%
MCV 86
MCH 29.2
MCHC 33.9
RDW 14.4
Platelets 258
Neutrophils 54%
Lymps 37%
Monocytes 8%
Neutrophils Absolute 1.6
Lymps 1.1
Vitamin b 12 253
Ferritin 16

All my levels came back to normal except for my WBC. it dropped another .5 And my neutrophils absolute also dropped slighly below normal. Should I be concerned? My gyno told me to see my family doctor. I did and he told me I was fine and didnt seem concerned at all. He was only in the room for a few minutes so I feel like I need some sort of second oppinion. Im a small 23 yr old. Ive never weighed over 100 pds and ive always suffered from anemia. It comes and goes. I had heavy menstrual cycles before birth control. I stay tired but I also work two jobs and go to school part time.  I dont know if I am just freaking myself out worrying or if I do need to see another doctor. Any advice would be wonderful!! Thanks!

                I have been sick for over two years now.  I have lost 40+ pounds without dieting. My recent WBC  is abnormally low--and so is my Neutrophils (Absolute) low.  I have a slightly high RBC.   Vitamin D deficiency.  Slightly high Potassium, serum.  Low DHEA-sulfate (16.3). I'm always exhausted, achy,and have consistent  low body temperature (94-96 degrees) especially in the morning!  I'm also experiencing memory fog, memory loss, and confusion. (I take PROZAC for depression) I had a complete hysterectomy 15+ years ago--yet I experience "" hot flashes"" several times a day (accompanied by nausea, dizziness, extreme sweating, and muscle weakness). I had barr-epstein mononucleosis last year for months.  The accompanying extremely sore mouth has not healed but continues to burn and has deep""fissures"" in it --with chronic bad breath! My entire family and my close friends say I have changed dramatically in personality and that my confusion and memory loss are extreme! I will be 65 yrs. old in Jan 2013.  I also have migraine headaches at least 3 times a week.  My vision is ""messed-up"" quite often--even though I have had 2 ""Lazik surgeries.  I have had ""flashes"" of light (like a lightbulb flash) occur in my vision dozens of times--and street lights at night look like sparklers!  I have 3 bulging discs in my neck with uncinate process spurring, severe right foraminal stenosis with C-6 nerve impingement!   Also:  Grade 2 C6-C7 broad-based central bulge, right posterolateral and

broad-based central disc bulge!  My right hip is worn out and needs replacement! I FEEL ROTTON! I've been scheduled for surgery--but had the DR. cancel at the last minute!  Now I have to go on Medicare because I'm turning 65 years old.  If the DR's that have been ""covered"" under my 2regular policies haven't offered me much help or solutions for my on-going ""bad"" health--what hope do I have for finding solutions when I have to go on Medicare?  I've basically ""given-up"" when it comes to seeing Doctors for solutions!  I am in pain and feel like completely ""withdrawing"" from the world altogether!  If I didn't believe that suicide is very morally wrong and selfish--I wouldn't stick around in this painful, sick body much longer!   I AM VERY, VERY DISCOURAGED!

                Experts,
I'm a 29 yr old male and have been having tiny black been sized swollen lymph nodes under my jaw and neck. Details:

1. In August, I had a swollen lymph node under my left jaw that remained there for 4 weeks. Doctor prescribed me amoxicillin 875mg twice a day for 5 days. 2 weeks later it went down. 
2. In October a node appeared under my right jaw. I repeated same medicine and it went down in couple weeks. 
3. Another one of same size appeared in November very close to the second one under my right jaw. I didn't take any medication but it went down automatically in 2-3 weeks
4. I have a similar sized one on the left side of my upper neck that came up 4 days ago. It's red and pains when o touch.  I haven't seen a doctor and not taken any medication. 

I recently had cold and cough that lasted for a week with fever upto 99.9 for a day. No other symptom. I do not have any swollen lymphs in my groin or armpits. 

I went for rapid HIV testing 10 days ago after reading about swollen nodes online can be  due to HIV. Results were negative. 

I have been little worried about these frequently swelling nodes. 
Please advise. 
Thanks.

                The advantage is a shorter administration time (10 minute injection), supposedly with the same safety.

It uses ""Enhanze"" delivery:

                Hello

Im a 22 year old female and im  just a little curious about a problem im having at the moment. 5 nights ago I was doing some cartwheels in a park just being silly with my friends and I dont remember hurting myself.

But a day or 2 later I noticed the top of my left forearm was aching and was kind of swollen. It ached for about a day but since has stopped and only aches ocasionally.

I was feeling my arm today and ive noticed it feels quite bumpy, I had a friend feel it and she said it feels different compared to my right arm and I noticed when she pushed on a certain spot it ached for a second, it also feels kind of weak and if I move my wrist around I can feel the muscle move and push on what I think is a lump. Im kind of scared now.

I dont feel unwell or anything so could it be a strained muscle or what does it sound like?

                I experience severe bone pain after ingesting alcohol, that can last for hours. I have a history of Hodgkin's Lymphoma in remission for 3.5 years. The bone pain is in my hips and legs, and it's 10 out of 10 severity. I have been experiencing this for the past 3 months or so, and it's becoming more severe. Not sure if this is cancer in my bones or avascular necrosis?  Confused. My last pet scan 3 months ago was clear...other than my bones lighting up some. Arthritis was ruled out by rheumatologist. Not sure if this is a rare kind of HL in the bones, and no where else. Last time I had HL it was in the mediastinal region, and I was stage 2b. I didn't have a bone marrow biopsy then, though my bones were bright on pet scans. So...who knows? Maybe it's been in my bones all along. Or is it something else?

                Swollen lymph nodes in left armpit, left elbow area and behind left leg where knee bends. Just swollen enough to be able to noticablly grab them, so doctors and nurse practioners can definalety palpate or feel them, but they are not extremely large, although they were about twice as large prior to reduction in size about 20 days after initial swelling. History : I had sex with a woman at the end of June. The next morning I felt like I had vd. Ten days later I went to a doctor to get treated for suspected vd, with swollen lymph nodes, but all tests were negative including HIV and RPR tests at 2 months and at three months. Was also swabbed twice for gono and chlamydia but they were neg. I was treated with various antibiotic, including cipro, z pack, and eventully doxycycline a couple of weeks later. After I began taking doxy, the swelling in the lymph nodes began to go down a little, but it did not go down by much. The pain and swelling was primarily in the left armpit, elbow and behind the left leg where it bends. I have since had these swollen lymph nodes for 5 months. All blood tests were normal/neg ,except I did show I had been exposed to Epstein Barr at some point, though I have never had symptoms of mono, other than if my swollen lymphs from June are from Epstein Barr, which can be a possible link to hodkins from what I am reading. I have an apt Tuesday to probably be referred to a histologist for lymph biopsy. My biggest concern is how quickly would this stuff generally spread to other nodes. Would it be stage 3 if lymph nodes in my armpit, elbow and knee are infected with the cells? If I have had this for 5 months, am I most likely uncurable at this point if it is hodgkins? I was also tested for hep and was neg for them, as well as up to date on hep vaccines. Liver panels all good.

                About 6 months ago, I went to my Doctor and got a total physical. To my surprise, my mamo came back showing I have a lump deep within my left breast near my chest wall. It was very dense and they performed a core biopsy which turned out fine. They also ""marked the spot"", for future exams, with a small titanium ribbon. Since then, I have burning and soreness in that breast and down my upper arm. Sometimes, it even feels like I have a little tenderness and burning in my neck and inner left thigh. Any idea what might be causing this? I talked with the nurse and asked if she thought it could be from the implanted marker but, she doesn't think so. I am returning for a follow up mamogram next month.

                For about two years now I have been able to feel what to me now feels like a swollen gland on the back of my neck, to the left hand side of my spine probably about 2cm wide. It is quite deep and I can only feel it with my hands when I tip my head to the right.
It isn't painful, but I am aware of it when moving my head around. It sometimes seems to make my left ear click too after I press it or when moving my head.
I have spoken with 3 doctors, one thought it was muscular and said to massage it, then one said it's not muscular but can't feel anything wrong so don't massage it, another couldn't feel anything but sent me for an ultrasound for my peace of mind and they couldn't see anything out of the ordinary. But I can't stop worrying about it and fiddling with it, I'm so worried it could be lymphoma or something but I don't want to cause a fuss unnecessarily.
Any ideas? Should I go to doctors again or just try and forget it?

                I've had an approx 1/2"" lump so close to my vertebra at C-7, I thought it was the vertebra. (never knew there were lymph nodes there!)  It's been there quite a while.  It is firm and rubbery and never bothered me.  I am rarely sick & cannot even remember the last time I had a cold or flu. Then the other day, my neck was very stiff & painful and I was unable to move it up/down or left/right.  Saw a chiro who told me it was swollen lymph node.  And, in fact, it appears there are 2 more close to it, also firm/rubbery feeling.  The major one is about 1/2"" diam; the others approx 1/3"".  I have terrible night sweats, but that could be menopausal? I don't feel like eating, only snacking when very hungry and do not have much energy, have lost about 13 pounds in 3 months.  I am a 60 y.o. woman. And, unfortunately, have no insurance. Question is:  do these symptoms sound serious enough to be seen?  Bigger question: given that I have to pay cash & am on a fixed income - which diagnostic procedure will rule out lymphoma right away because I cannot afford  to pay for a bunch of other tests?  I want to just ""cut to the chase"".  Thank you.

I am a 30 year old female. I have had ongoing lymphnode pain an swelling for over 4 years now. swollen along jaw bone, neck and throad area, low grade fever 100. intermitent. The pressure from the swollen glands causes sever headaches that keep me up each night. Sometimes the swollen glads last for months or weeks, I do have days here and there where i feel pretty good. But other days I am so discouraged that i just sit and read post from others hoping to find out whats wrong with me. All Labs Complete CBC, and all other fun ones come back normal for the most part. There has been a few times they were elevated but the they never stay that way. I dont seem to know much about all the testing but both sides of my family have died from cancer, my grandpa died from lymphoma. My doctor says my labs show 'm heathy and I just cant seem to get him to understand how terrible I really feel and that I know this is not normal!

                Hello everyone! 
I'll start at the beginning. About this time last year I had a bad case of tonsillitis which naturally made the lymph nodes in my neck swell up significantly. Since then, it's felt like they have not really gone down. There's 4 or 5 under my jaw that are quite firm. They're symmetrical on both sides and seem to fluctuate in size quite a lot. On the left side of my neck there is another lump but it feels different. It moves more readily and almost seems like it runs away from my fingers. It is hard, though, but doesn't seem to grow.
In August I noticed a hard (what I'm assuming) is a lymph node in the right side of my groin. It moves slightly and is quite circular. It doesn't seem to have grown much and again, fluctuates in size. There is another, smaller one in that side of my groin also. 
I've lost quite a lot of weight over the last 6 months but I am not sure if this could be a symptom or just because I haven't been eating as much. I have no other symptoms, no night sweats or itching or anything.
I intend to go and see a doctor as soon as I can but does this sound like its likely to be lymphoma to anyone?
Thank-you very much!

                Hello everyone, a few weeks ago my son started out with a high fever and complaining of back pain.  We thought maybe something kidney or urinary related as he was urinating as often..of course we know this could be because of the fever.  We saw his doctor and he ordered a CBC and flu culture.  The first CBC two weeks ago came back with elevated WBC, and the doc gave him a shot of Rocephin and put him on Zythromax.  After the meds, he seemed to be doing better, the fever was down.  After about 24 hours of being off, the fever came back at about 102, then came down and hung out at a low grade of around 100.5 rectally.  The other day, I noticed a large lump under his armpit, and the doctor did confirm it was a lymph node.  I ended up with a different doctor, thank goodness because I wasn't getting answers before.  He ordered another CBC with a Sed rate count.  WBC came back still elevated and his platelets have doubled and are now elevated.  His neutriphils are a little high as well.  His Sed rate came back at 77, and normal is 0-15.  He is still runing low grades.  No other symptoms, he has tested negative for flu, mono, and menigitis.  Urine came back fine as well as blood cultures.  We have been referred to a hemotology doctor.  What are your thoughts in this?  He has remained pretty hush on the topic.  You can look at my son and tell his not himself.  Hes a ball of energy, and he still has his moments, and other moments he just looks drained.  His doctor wanted me to wait for his brother to gegt back into the country, however that would put us in Decemeber to get him seen.  Im not comfortable with his brother, so I was able to get an appointment with nemours childrens clinic.  I would rather not go into this blindly, any light that can be shed please let me know.

                My father had AML leukemia i was wondering what causes it? He didnt live long after they diagnosis him just 2 weeks. Is this hereditary?

                I have a hard lump almost the size of a golf ball located under my armpit. It actually is located more like the bottom of my shoulder, it is really hard to explain the location. I went and had an ultrasound in the ER thinking it may have been an abcess, even though it is painless except when it is pushed, I feel pain in my side down to my legs. The actual lump does not hurt. The er ultrasound gave measurements 5.7 cm on one side, 4.2 on another, and 3.4 on the others, the outside feels like it is just round. Anyways, I went to my primary, she wanted it taken out, but the surgeons told her I had to wait because it was not an emergency,I have had no biopsy but did have a CT. As far s those results, I thought no call means good news, but when I went to my doc for something else, she told me the radiologist hadn't even read the scan yet, its been 6 days. I guess I am stressed out and now my neck has a lump, anyways my question is can they tell if it is cancerous just from a CT and ultrasound? My friends do not understand why no one has offered to biopsy it, the lump even though in my upper body is causing me to have a hard time walking and the pain in my flank is getting worse as the days go on. And now my throat is feeling tight and I am becoming hoarse, it is just really stressing me out. Oh and I did have blood work which was not normal but my doc said it had nothing to do with the lump, she said I was fighting an infection and from what she read I was not acute at the time of the withdrawal.

                I am a 30-years-old male.

I have swollen lymph nodes on both sides of my neck, which an ultrasound scan determined are sub-centimetric and hyperplastic, ""with non-specific structure"". I also feel a submandibular one, which however wasn't scanned because I had not noticed it yet at the time I took the scan (and my doctor can't feel it).
They aren't painful, although they sometimes seem to ""sting"" a bit, although near the submandibular one (assuming it's really there) I sometimes feel some pain and have other symptoms (such as difficulty opening my jaw completely).
I feel by touch that the 4 lymph nodes shown in the scan have shrunk a little now, while other previously normal lymph nodes have swollen.
For reference, the scan also detected two 5mm colloid-cyst formations (if that's the right English term) in my thyroid.

I took a few blood tests, and everything is normal except for elevated levels of Epstein-Barr VCA IgG (but not IgM) of 470 units/ml, which were 23 units/ml in 2010. The stated threshold is 20. My VCA IgG was already positive many years ago, when I was about 10, though I don't think the IgM has ever been caught positive.

I also had a chest x-ray, which showed no particular problems, even though unfortunately I'm a heavy (20 a day) smoker.

An EMT doctor diagnosed me with GERD laryngitis.

So my doctor thinks it might be a relapse of mononucleosis, and doesn't seem to worry much, also considering the swollen lymph nodes she could feel seemed ""mobile"", and that the blood tests showed nothing special. However, I must say I'm not convinced and, justifiably or not, am very concerned.

Four months ago, I had a small dental surgery: since an x-ray on a problematic tooth seemed inconclusive as to whether there was a fracture, the dentist decided to cut through the gums, and found there was root resorption.
My problems all seemed to start after this surgery.

My symptoms are (or have been, some are intermittent), roughly in order of time they started showing up:
- sensation of teeth not fitting like before, after the dental surgery; this persisted
- ""burning"" or ""pressing"" chest pain, now mostly a sense of pressure on the sternum
- tachycardia (initially 120-130 ppm at rest, now between 80 and 100), shortness of breath, difficulty swallowing and sense of chocking with a lump in my throat
- numbness and tingling of arms and (to a lesser extent) legs during the night, causing me to wake up several times
- particularly marked wrinkling of my hands' palms and fingertips after short showers, followed by some skin peeling off between the fingers (and I still think my hands look a fair bit more wrinkled than before this started)
- extreme anxiety
- waking up during the night with the feeling I wasn't breathing (this has stopped happening)
- big night sweats a few times (had to turn the pillow over because it was too wet)
- testicular / low abdominal moderate (well, felt strong to me) pain, which recurred for about a week, then, so far, didn't happen again
- loss of weight from around 62kg to 53.5kg (though this might be due to the fact I stopped taking a low-dosage anti-psychotic, Abilify, which had caused weight increase before from an original very low weight of 43kg around 3 years ago)
- one episode of sudden loss of equilibrium (I was sitting and felt like I had been pushed forward), followed by the sensation of staggering for a couple of days
- a dull aching sensation that soon turned into a burning sensation in the upper part of my right arm, made worse (quite strong) by moving the arm in certain ways
- a small ""bony"" swelling on the left side of my head's back (lower part of the scalp), I can't feel a similar swelling on the right side so I assume it's not a bone
- loud jaw clicking (from the left of my jaw), especially after waking up, and for a week or so, inability to open my jaw completely
- clicking of most articulations
- mild pain that comes and goes in various parts of my limbs; the hands, in particular, often give me strange sensations
- mild pain at the left side of my jaw, sometimes when breathing, sometimes when ingesting liquids, sometimes when opening it; mild pain in the left ear when touching it; strange, vague sensations in my left check, reaching the left eye and ear
- a visible swelling at the right side of my left foot, after mild pain at that location (the pain has now subsided), with a blood vessel looking particularly dark at that spot
- another swelling (but much smaller, not visible) on my left hand, again after some mild pain in it

Are some of these symptoms suggestive of a lymphoma? Might it be a good idea to pressure my doctor into some kind of lymph node biopsy? Might it be a sign of some other type of cancer (EMT doctor and dentist saw no signs of oral / throat cancers)?

I've been feeling extremely anxious given the amount of new symptoms in a relatively short period of time (4 months or so) that don't seem to be easily explained.

                Hiya,

Around 2 weeks ago now I found a bean sized, moveable lump on the side of my neck. I instantly went into panic and have stayed that way since. The first doc said it was nothing to worry about and felt like a normal lymph node to him but would run bloods to put my mind at ease. The next nurse I saw said it felt like fatty tissue around the node and I need a blood test and ultra sound. The final doc I saw, felt it and said it is about a cm and moveable, see if it goes down in 3 weeks and if not come back. I said then I may have felt it 4-5months before and brushed it off (I can't remember if I am honest), well her face changed and she referred me to an ENT on Tues. I ran my bloods which will be back in today (hopefully). But now all I can think is I have got lymphoma (they asked me if I had any B symptoms each time) and then referred me. I am living through an absolute nightmare right now, I can't think of anything else, I keep touching the lump and I swear it has got bigger (also not a good sign), I keep think I am itching, I have even read treatments and stuff to prepare myself!

Anyway I will update... 2 weeks ago I did not even know what Lymphoma was and now I am OBSESSED!

Thanks for listening

                I KNOW THAT I NEED TO TALK TO MY DOCTOR, BUT AS I WAIT FOR THAT APPOINTMENT TO ARRIVE, I'M JUST ASKING FOR SUGGESTIONS.  
I have SLE (lupus) and have some symptoms that overlap with lymphoma.  
I am losing weight constantly without trying..... Went from 183 to 147 and doc is concerned with the weight loss, but not really digging into that.
I am itching with no rash for a week as of tomorrow.  It is quite uncomfortable and Benadryl will calm it down, but it never is really gone, and this is driving me crazy.
I have night sweats constantly.  Needing to change pajamas in the middle of the night, and my husband keeps suggesting that I sleep on a towel.... 
I'm 34, no history of cancer in my immediate family.  
I have had lumps in my armpits quite often, but not at the present.
Once had some under my earlobe.

Does anyone think this could possibly be something to further investigate or just assume it's the lupus (if any of you are familiar with lupus symptoms....)

THANKS SO MUCH FOR YOUR HELP

                Hello, 
I'm a 21 year old female, around the beginning of June I noticed a quarter sized lump on the lining of my jaw/ear lobe. Didn't think too much of it and just thought it was a swollen lymph node as I usually get them. Whenever I do get swollen lymph nodes, they usually appear from a cold and go away within the week, but I started noticing the lump wasn't changing in size, and also it was extremely tender to touch. About the third week I decided to make myself an appointment to see my Dr. He told me it looked like it was cat scratch fever from what my symptoms sounded like. He took some blood tests and told me he wanted to see if I had any infection, but not to worry. A few days after my visit I noticed two more tiny lumps developed on the side of my neck, and they grew quickly (also a size of a Nickle/quarter). My energy decreased, I started getting sharp pains on the side of my head/temple and very often the lumps would swell up very big where it would make the side of my face puff out, but then would release after a few hours.  My Dr. called me within a few days after to go over my results and have another check up, My blood results came back clean with no signs of anything unusual. I told him about the extra lumps and my other symptoms. He decided to have an ultrasound done, a few weeks after he told me he wanted an MRI done. I barely had my MRI around August 16th and a follow up with my Dr. on August 24th. It appeared that there are ""multiple nodules scattered throughout the right parotid gland, of uncertain etiology, although these probably represent lymph nodes. The appearance is suggestive of a benign lymphoepithelial process. Neoplastic etiology cannot be excluded"" He tried explaining to me what it meant but I'm really confused on what it actually means. He wants to send me to a specialist to confirm what it is.  Has anyone else gone through this? I'm just tired of waiting for answers and the pain on the side of my head is really starting to get to me.

I went to the doctors and they were immediately concerned due to the location of the node. I have been through two rounds of blood work, an EKG, two ultrasounds, a full body ct scan, a mammogram and an excisional biopsy. After the biopsy the surgeon told my family that he was certain that I have lymphoma. I am  now waiting for the official results. I do get a low grade fever every evening and the only other symptom I have is EXTREME thirst. I just cant seem to get enough water. I dont want anything else either, just water. You have to understand too that I have NEVER been a water drinker which i know is not good, but I dont like it. Is this a known symptom for lymphoma? i havent seen it anywhere other than with people who are currently undergoing chemo.

Stupid i know and i regret it and feel guity about it now. I was admitted to a ward for the night which was absolutely mortifying for me. They judge you badly in there for taking an overdose they dont wonder why they just think your wasiting there time which i suppose i was. But it goes alot deeper than that which i will explaine now. I havnt been physically well for a number of months. Ive had terrible burning itchy skin from my head down to my toes literally. I scratch and scratch till i bleed and am covered in scares. I get red spots on my skin which do blister when i scratch them. I have always thought it was bed bugs as i have seen a few in my bedroom. But the itching is everywhere even on my face. It happens during the day when im completely covered and just put on clean freshly washed clothes. I have anemia and vitamin D defiency. Also have rosacea on my face. I have bad hayfeaver and always sneezing. I have ibs issues also. Am very tired all the time. Though im not loosing weight  im more putting it on. I dont have night sweats. Do you have to have all the lymphoma symptoms to have it? Anyway going back to the hospital episode. While i was in there it really freaked me out because a couple months ago i had a couple of skin punctures on my leg. I havent yet had the results from it yet. I kept hearing them say mrs b has lymphoma then that reason why she taken an overdose because she is worried and the nurses agreed with him. They didnt tell me directly because it was a hospital ive never been to before. But i even heard this when i was sent to the ward so i cant of been somthing else. I might just be my paranoia but it was so clear to me and i heard one of the nurses say to somone else dont judge the women in room 9 because she is sick she has lymphoma and she doesnt know yet. Im really really really freaked out and sooo stressed with it. Im trying to not think the worst but its hard not to after going through that. Please help am at the end of teather x

                hi, i need help. my grandma hates going to the doctor, she literally has a phobia of knowing whatever her sickness might be or if she has an actual sickness, but recently when offered a free blood glucose test and bp measurement she tried it. her blood glucose level was 221, and her bp was 100/70. the community nurse who conducted the tests advised her to go to a laboratory for some tests involving an fbs and cbc also a urinalysis. after days of arguing with her she finally agreed to go the laboratory, everything were normal except her fbs is 201.1 (normal: 60-110) and her cbc shows lymphocytes of 46 (normal:25-25). now I am still in the process of convincing her to see a doctor now that we have her results for more than 3 days. what does it mean? is she a diabetic already? what type and what treatment? what does the high lymphocyte count mean? I am very concerned for her i hope you can help so that i can explain to here the severity of her problem. a reply would be really appreciated. thanks!

                Im a 23 year old male, and I have had a swollen submandibular lymph node on the left side since March of 2012.  It isn't huge, and it is very mobile.  I can move it to the outside of my jaw and feel it and then move it back in.  

My doctor took a look at it in July (I was out of the country from March to July), and said it was a shotty lymph node and that he wasn't worried.  My lab values at the time were all within the normal ranges and he said I look completely healthy besides that little node.

For the past month, both of my shoulder have been sore in the axilla region.  Sometimes the pain goes away when I sit up straight, and I really only notice it when I am home alone and not occupied with anything else.

About 10 days ago, I woke up with a red circle the size of a quarter above my right nipple.  It was painful to touch and a bit warm to the touch.  That is when I also noticed a swollen LN in my right axilla (I hadnt noticed any before the bite, I had been checking due to the discomfort/pain I had been feeling).  I went to a CVS minute clinic, because I wanted antibiotics (I am out of town again, and away from my doctor).  She said the circle on my chest was most likely a bug bite, and prescribed 250mg of keflex q6h for 10 days.

I am on day 7 of the keflex, and the bite/red circle has mostly gone away, but I can still see a small outline of it.  It is still a bit sore to the touch.  The lymph node in my right axilla is still present, and has not increased or decreased in size (the PA at CVS said it was a single lymph node).  It is painless and pretty mobile.

I am wondering if this is a cause for concern.  The lymph node in my neck hasn't changed in size at all in the last six months.  But now I have this node in my axilla as well (I am wondering if it is related to the bug bite, or whatever the red circle on my chest was).  Should I call my doctor back home?  Or should I wait a few days and finish the keflex and see what happens?

I've had no fever or weight change since my checkup in July.

Thanks in advance for any advice.

                I am new to this forum.  My daughter, now age 21, is over ten years off treatment for ALL.  She was high risk with CNS involvement and had to have radiation along with 2.5 years chemo.  Her hair did fall out, however, after every one said it would come back, it never really did.  Her hair is very, very thin.  She worked  with young children over the summer and they kept asking her what was wrong with her hair.  She was to a dermatologist shortly after her treatment stopped, but no suggestions were made.  She is still in tears at times with her self image.  I had not done much research because, frankly, I am just glad she is alive and think she looks beautiful no mater what.  We almost lost her with all the chemo and the side effects she endured.  She has multiple other medical problems, mainly dealing with fatigue and mood disorder.  Had open heart surgery last year as well for a benign tumor.

Has anyone else had this situation and does anyone know if there is a way for her hair to be regrown.

                 I know the majority of you prob aren't doctors, but maybe could help from personal experiences . I am a 20 year old female who is normally very bubbly n full of energy, also with good health, had asthma as a kid and still do but only with extreme physical activity. for the past week I have been on vacation out of state. I have been not wanting to do a thing. I have been going to bed earlier than my little five year old cousin because I feel weak and no energy. I just want to cry. its been getting worse the past few days, I have been sleeping 12 hours a night n after 4 hours of being up I'm ready to sleep again. I do not feel like myself at all. and am having a hard time describing how I feel.. a little confused, very weak, no energy, tired, and no enthusiasm to do a thing. summer is my fav season because I LOVE to swim. today I could only float around the pool for about twenty min and my body physically couldn't do it anymore. I have also been bruising.like there is no tomorrow. someone had grabbed my arm in excitement n now have finger Mark bruises. does anyone know what could be wrong ? I feel so not like myself that I am going to see a doctor, but some in put for the time being, ( I have to wait four days to see doc) would be very much appreciated. thanks to everyone who answers me

 Oh and to add to this I have been havin hot flashes that make me start sweating outta no where. n I get up in the morning with my clothes soaked from sweating. so my main things are fatigue, bruising n sweating. And they're all at a very excessive point.

                Hi All I am a 29 yr old female. I have a history of PCOS, a single thyroid nodule, atrial flutter, high blood pressure, (very low cholesterol) and stomach ulcers. That pretty much it. 2 years ago I went on Metformin to treat my PCOS. It made me ill for months but after about 90 days I adjusted to the medication and I felt better. I had regular periods and felt less fatigued, food didnt make me tired gave me energy. I had had a difficult time loosing weight after having three kids at 5'4 I weighed about 190 I have always been an extremely healthy eater and exercised regularly. in March of 2012 I began noticing enlarged lymph nodes and a cpl days a week had episodes of fatigue and nausea. I chalked it up to working and stress (2 of 3 kids have chronic medical conditions and husband had just had surgery and chemo for bladder tumors) It became more frequent so I saw my dr and they thought I for sure had mono and I called the lab two days later for them to tell me my EBV was positive I was confused cause I had a bad case of mono at age 16? So I just figured I would feel better in a few weeks. My symptoms got worse and worse by April I could tell I had lost weight but I had been to tired to exercise so I didn't know why but was thrilled? ( i hate been trying so hard before) I continued to feel terrible till one day the nausea and lack of appetite were so bad. I was shaking and felt like my vision was blurry. I went straight to the dr who tested my blood sugar it was 60. The weird part is that on the way to the dr I had drinking about 8 ounces of orange juice because i didn't feel well? The doctor was concerned my metformin was causing this and he told me to quit taking it. Well I got way worse. Had blood sugars over 400 for eating some pulled pork plain... had lows as low as 37. Dr was sure I was diabetic... NOPE... I have ""spontaneouse reactive hypoglycemia"". I have been progressivly getting worse. AND Did not have mono lab was wrong it was positive but not activated!!! BUT i Cannot maintain my weight. I went from 192 in march to now august weighing 127. I have horrible nausea and lack of appetite. but still eating as much as I can nibble.  I am taking januvia to maintain blood sugar but still having daily lows. (below 70) I cant sleep good at night cause I am extremly hot behind my knees and legs sweat drips My neck back arms chest itchs all the time.  lymph nodes are still huge, I have tremors and dizzy spells, head aches, and ear pain from lymph node pressure. I have had shoulder and hip pain leg pains back and rib pain. Doctors have been running tests for months some abnormal some normal they don't point to exact cause but I feel I am slowly dying. Everyone around me is constantly concerned. I have been told multiple times they are sure they know what it is and they end up moving on. NOW my GP and ENT are SURE it is lymphoma. They just biopsied a new lesion that grew the last 9 months on my thyroid. its a cyst like mass of 1.8 c. and another new lesion of just under an inch. The ENt is expecting the thyroid to come back normal he is planning on surgically removing a large weird shaped lymph node from just under my jaw. I have about 6 lymph nodes in different areas they are concerned about. None of my doctors have made me feel crazy or not sick I believe they have honestly tried very hard to figure me out. I have had tons of scans tests you name it! I get my thyroid biopsy results back tomorrow and the ENT will be scheduling my surgery to remove lymph node. I am wondering if this is lymphoma how it was not detected in my other tests and if there are other options as I have read that finding a lymphoma after being very very ill for 5 month makes the prognosis worse. I am scared I have three kids who have chronic illness and need me to take care of them we have been through so much medically as a family in the last few years I honestly cant believe this is happening to me. Any help ideas advice is appreciated?

                Hi,
I have two swollen lymph nodes. One is on the left side of my neck, about a third to a half of the way up, another is a couple of inches away on my back, on that muscle that connects your neck to your shoulder. Both are rubbery-hard, the one on the back is definitely unmovable and the one on the neck I'm pretty sure is unmovable. Neither are visible unless I stretch my back or neck, and don't seem much larger than normal, though as I said they are visible when I stretch.

I'm freaked out that this is something major, I'm going to get it checked out soon but I'd just like to hear your opinions. I also experienced some rather severe full body itching a couple of weeks ago, though it went away after a few days. 

I should also note that I have hay fever, my mom is also allergic to quite a few things, she tested positive for 41 out of 42 allergens a few years ago, I'm hoping this is the cause of all of this. Thanks for your help.

I went to my regular doctor who said they looked like subcutaneous nodules and referred me to a derm. Ive been to two different deermatologists and have had two biopsies. both of which i dont think was a sufficient enough piece, and the pathology reports showed that by saying ""superficial perivascular lymphohistiocytic inflammatory cell infiltrate."" although they dont itch i tried the rx anti itch creams and steroids i was prescribed to no avail. i had bloodwork done to check my thyroid which came back fine. one biopsy was specifically tested  for fungal infection, lichen planus, and HIV, all of which came back negative. i have another biopsy schduled with a dermapathologist in a few days.Has anyone ever heard of something like this? are there certain things i should b looking for or asking? thanx in advance!

                Hi there. I hope someone can give me some advice. I've had horrible swollen neck for 3 months now. I don't have a sore throat or ear aches. I'm not losing any weight. I've been to the doctors multiply times. I've had many blood tests for mono, viral infections etc...all normal. I've had an ultra sound on my thyroid gland...normal (I have a family history of Thyroid cancer). I'm having another ultra sound on my whole neck in a week. I've taken antibiotics...first 3 days the swelling started to go down but by the time i'd finished the course, the swelling returned...a viral infection doesn't seem to be the answer. I suggested trying a stronger antibiotic, pure penicillin. Hopefully that will work but she doubts it will. I have an appointment with an ENT specialist in Jan...over a month away. I'm really worried about Hodgkins disease....Lymphoma...etc. I'm not sure if my doctor has considered this. Is there anything that I should be asking my doctor to do to test for these diseases...or but getting the US scan and seeing the ENT specialist, is the right course of action? Any advice anyone in the know can give me will be very much appreciated. Thank you in advance.
I'm 28yr old male...used to smoke up until March this year. I'm very healthy...work out at the gym 3 - 5 times a wk, I eat right and don't drink a lot.

                Hi, and thank you for taking the time for to review my questions. I am a 44 year old woman recently diagnosed with diverticulitis and put on cipro/flagyl for 10 days.  I was given both a ct scan and abdominal  xrays while in the ER for diverticulitis, both tests they did did not show any para aortic, or pelvic lymphedema. However, I just noticed that I have a swollen occipital node, it is non-tender about 1.5 cm in size and somewhat firm, it doesnt seem to move around much either. I have not recently been sick with cold etc...

I also  had a complete cbc that only showed eleved neutrophils and lowered lymphocytes which the dr said was indicitive of the diverticulitis infection. I have no other symptoms, no fatigue, night sweats, weight loss, fever etc. I dont notice any other swollen lymph nodes....

How concerned should I be about the possibility of lymphoma ? 

Thanks for your time!

                Hello everyone.

I just had a few questions. In early April I was tested for HIV and all other STD's and all the other tests and they were negative.
A few weeks later I went to my primary care doctor because I was still feeling very fatigued, constantly am spitting up mucus and had a swollen lymph node under my jaw, it was squishy and movable. She said that my lymph node felt normal and she ran a whole bunch of tests (allergy etc.) This was a couple weeks ago and she still didn't call so and she said if she didn't call then all is well. However today I felt and I have two swollen lymph nodes under my jaw, toward my ear. They don't hurt and they're not visible. In fact I had to press kind of hard to feel them. I'm just worried that they can be cancerous. I feel like something is wrong with me. I am in my early 20's and I'm very tired and those two swollen lymph nodes are scaring me. Please help. Thanks so much for your time.

                Hi everyone
I am really afraid that I may have lymphoma, and that the diagnosis may have been missed a long time ago.
about 2 years ago, i had a CT scan in the ER and the doctor said that i had ""some scattered lymph nodes, a thickened appendix, and a thickened umbilicus"". He said it meant nothing. I asked my doctor about it a few days later, and he said that the report he got didnt say anything about lymph nodes...I dont know if that means that the ER Dr. overread the scan, or if the radiologist shrugged off something that should have been noted. 

More recently, I keep getting sick (mostly colds, sore throats, bronchitis, and twice in the last 2 months i had pneumonia), My left arm has been swollen for about 8 months (had a doppler and it is not a vascular issue), I have a very very small enlarged node on the left side of my neck that i just found today,  Ive been getting these unbelievably painful sharp stabbing almost shock-like pains in both my armpits (comes and goes. only happens once in a while, though), the soles of my feet and the palms of my hands get a painful itching feeling deep under the skin every time i come into contact with water for more than about 2 minutes (aquagenic pruritas), Ive been having night sweats on and off for a few months, I've lost 10lbs this past week, and Ive been super exhausted lately. Although admittedly, that could just be from stressing over all the symptoms Ive been having...The good news is that, other than the little one in my neck, i dont seem to have any other palpable enlarged lymph nodes anywhere.  
Am I right to be fearful that an early lymphoma diagnosis may have been missed a couple of years ago? Or does this all seem more like a random assortment of symptoms that probably have nothing to do with cancer? 
I had some bloodwork done yesterday. I guess Ill know more after it comes back.  In what ways does lymphoma affect bloodwork? What does it change? (the Dr - not specifically looking for lymphoma - ran a CBC, liver function, kidney function, glucose, and ANA)
Sorry everyone, I know this was long and rambly. I'd really appreciate any insight anyone has. thanks!

                Hello,
  I have had low grade fever, night sweats, extreme fatigue and cervical lymphadenopathy for about 8 months with weight loss. My CT three months ago showed bilateral shotty jugulodigastric nodes with largest at 0.7cm, this month an ultrasound showed  that several of the nodes are now 2cm. My symptoms continue and I have had numerous labwork done with no answers. My WBC was normal but trending up and is now 11.1, my MPV was 9.7 last year, 7.6 two months ago and trending down, now at 6.7. Recent lymph node FNA showed ""mixed population of lymphocytes with rare macrophage"". Could their be a concern for leukemia or lymphoma? The doctors still are unable to find a cause for the increasing lymphadenopathy and symptoms.

Thank you for your time and help

                Hi, I'm a 23 year old female. I have had pretty significant weight loss over the past 1 1/2 years... at first I really enjoyed the weight loss but now friends and family have begun commenting on how much I have lost and are concerned that it is too much too fast without me trying or doring anything to lose the weight. In October/November 2010 I was 210 pounds, I am now 127 pounds. I am still in a normal range for my height, which is why my doctors haven't questioned it too much, but the fact that is is still happening at about the same rate as eariler worries me, in October 2011 I was 150 pounds. 

For the past few months I have been getting fevers as well, in the 101-103*F I'll run a fever about every 3-4 days or so otherwise my temperature is normal. 

I have also had itching all over my body (this has been something I've had for the past year or so, it comes and goes in intensity) but sometimes at night when I'm sleeping I will scratch so bad I cause myself to bleed. My skin isn't particulaly dry and I use allergen free for everything (soaps, lotions, etc). 

I also deal with fatigue/weakeness but my doctors have never been able to find a cause for it and it's something I have adjusted to living with. 

For me the weight loss is the most worrying symptom right now, what really worries me is when I look up causes of weight loss everything pretty much all of the causes have been ruled out except for a maligancy like lymphoma, then when looking up lymphoma I see so many similar symptoms to mine I get even more worried. 

I feel crazy for worrying about this, because I think I can't possibly have lymphoma. What do you guys think am I just going crazy here? Has dr google taken over my mind? I have a doctors appointment tomorrow, but I'm not sure how to bring this up... I really feel crazy for even thinking this and that I should just let it go but there is that little voice in the back of my head that just won't let it go. 

Any advice, opinions, comments greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance!

                I'm a 43 year old female. I noticed my left arm was swollen March 2 and felt like scrambled eggs underneath the skin. I went to the health clinic at work and she took some measurements of both arms starting from bicep to wrist and my swelling started in my upper arm but I just didn't notice it until it got to my forearm. Now I've noticed weakness in my arm and I'm not sure if I want to call it numbness but it feels almost like its a sleep but without the pin pricking in parts of it. It was aching off and on but that has subsided but the swelling isn't going down. I went to the ER and they put me on some strong antibiotics thinking its a case of cellulitus (staff infection) but I've been on the antibiotics for over a week and the swelling still isn't going down. A couple days after starting the meds I developed a cough and a fever and hot and cold spells and just feeling very weak. Since I had heart surgery a couple of years ago they looked for blood clots to see if this was the problem but the tests came back clean. I called my doctor after I developed the fever, cough, etc and she seems to think I got the flu bug on top of whatever this is going on with my arm. In the past week I've been to the ER, the health clinic at work, my primary care doc and my heart doc. All tests at heart doc are coming back good so far but my primary care doc said to just stay on antibiotics for now to see if there's a change. I just don't know what to make of this. The lady at the clinic felt my armpits for large lymphs but said they felt ok. So it seems to be in my left arm only from the shoulder and both sides of my arm all the way to my wrist (almost). Any ideas?

Its hard and has a cylindrical shape (like a vein). when i bend my neck down it appears as though a vein on top of it is bulging but is connected to it. it is about 1 cm tall when my neck isn't bent and is underneath the skin and doesn't move. 
i went and showed it to the doctor about 8 months ago. he looked at it and touched it and didn't pay any attention to it and said that it was nothing. After about 3 months i went to him again and told him that it is still there and i think that it has gotten bigger by the smallest amount (maybe a hair or i was just paranoid) and he again looked at it, touched, poked, pinched felt it between his fingers and again told me that it is nothing to worry and that it could stay forever. 
but what actually is it???!!! 
i am very paranoid, anxious and scared that it could be something bad as although he said it could stay forever its still on my neck and i want to know what it is!! 
I'm thinking about showing it to another doctor sometime this week but before i do i wanted to hear your opinions.

                The last couple of times I have consumed alcohol my glands have become swollen and painful the next day.

The first incident my neck glands swollen and became very sore.
The last two have caused pain in my groin area the next day- my glands here have been noticeable here for a couple of weeks.. Feel pea size, relatively firm and painless most of the time.

The doctor have examined me and felt a swollen gland in one of my armpits and either side of my groin. (my neck ones had gone down)

I have had blood tests and they have come back clear. I have booked another appointment with the Doctor as the day after drinking alcohol( the first two times, I probably had a little too much, but the latest episode I only had a couple of alcoholic beverages) different areas are tender and achey.

Has anyone heard of this before? I am aware that this is also a symptom of Hodgkins (chronicle Google self diagnoser) but I believe this symptom usually occurs almost immediately after consuming alcohol.

I don't feel my Doctor is taking me seriously and would really appreciate any feedback whilst I wait for my appointment.

I know consuming lots of alcohol is bad for you and symptoms would cease if I stopped my alcohol in-take just these symptoms have never happened before and I am concerned of my constantly raised groin glands

                Hello, I have been tested in the end of January for my annual blood work, and requested to be tested for Lyme Disease. Everything came back in perfect range except for the Lyme Disease. I requested the LD test due to and extensive list of symptoms and I did find a tick on myself when I was maybe 12 years of age, when i went to the doctor then it was negative and the doctor stated there was no bite mark (mind you the tick was in my hairline). When I was tested in the end of January, 2012 the Lyme Disease test came back positive of a 1.49 but both the IgG and the Igm came back negative. I was told I needed to see an Infectious Disease Specialist but was unsuccessful in obtaining one so i went ahead and did extensive research and found other diseases that may make a Lyme result such as mine. I went to my OB/GYN and requested to be tested in the end of April, 2012 for Syphilis, HIV/AIDS, and Herpes as i also do annually. The HIV/AIDS, and the Syphilis came back negative, the Herpes 1 and 2 test came back negative for the IgG, but the Igm Herpes 1 and 2 combitnation came back positive for a 1.34 result. I have been with my husband for over two years and we are faithful. I have finally found a Infectious Disease Specialist after extensive phone calls and dead ends, but my appointment isnt for another several weeks. I was hoping maybe someone had some insight and could make some sense of this. I have never had a blister of any shape or form, I am severely desperate and no one is able to make sense of it and has never heard of this type of situation. My symptoms consist of memory problems, muscle weakness, concentrations problems, constant fatigue, muscle fatigue, speech problem, flesh colored dry patches up both of my arms and under my breast plate, over all cognitive reduction, three new tiny moles the size of a pencil tip brown and flesh color mix, vertigo like symptoms, dizziness, lake of energy, Bipolar symptoms, vibrating sensations through out one part or whole body, heart palpitations, tachycardia, shortness of breath, vision problems (seeing different colored spots red, orange, blue, white, black, green, etc.), over all sensitivity to surroundings, seeing shadows and movement through pereferal vision when nothing is there, numbness and tingling, muscle twitches in face and extremities, shooting pains throughout body and head, neck stiffness, muscle pain, back pain, frequent constipation with lower abdominal pain, and more i cant seem to remember or think.

                I recently had an ultrasound for enlarged left axillary lymph nodes.  The results showed:  a circumscribed heterogeneously hypoechoic nodular focus measuring 2.6cm and another measuring 1.3cm.  I just got back from the surgeon who was not overly impressed by these findings and is not even sure if a biopsy is warranted.  She's going to talk to her radiologist first.  I'm very uncomfortable with not doing anything about them and felt my questions weren't answered today.  Anyone have any suggestions on what this report means and what can be causing these enlarged nodes.

                Hi Everybody, (any HCV friends over here with yet ANOTHER disease?)

Had extensive bloodwork due to fatigue, night sweats, general ill feeling, swollen salivary glands.  All tests including autoimmune came back normal, with the exception of basophils elevated at 1.2 (range 0.0 -- 1.0).  That sent me straight to the internet which convinced me I have a catastrophic disease, perhaps chronic lymphocytic leukemia which I see is associated with cryoglobulonemia which I had caused by HCV.  I treated and cured HCV in 2008 which cured the cryo.  Also sodium and chloride blood levels are low.

So my question is:  what does it mean when you have high basophils but normal WBC?

Thanks MedHelp friends.

                I had breast cancer, 5 years ago at 30 years old, and have just come off my medication.  My husband and I are now starting to try and have a baby, so I was very happy when I got my period back. I started having a dull, tingly but bearable pain at the start of my period.  I thought it was ovulation pain but that is not meant to last this long I thought.  On saying that, I think the ovulation this time was on the left side also.  This pain has continued for 2 weeks and then just yesterday it became unbearable and I had to take pain killers. (The pain is back to normal again though and bearable.) At this time I also felt a small bean sized lump on the left side of my abdomen, and was slightly tender to touch.   I went to the doctor today and she said that it looks like my lymph node is swollen.  Is this normal and is there any cause for concern that it might be something more serious?  I am trying to get an appointment to see a specialist now.

                I have a very good book called Living with Lymphoma by Elizabeth Alder.  Ms. Alder is a nuerobiologist who was also diagnosed herself with lymphoma.  It is filled with tons of scientific facts and information.  It has become my lymphoma bible and I often turn to it for answers to my own questions.  I was thinking that I would like to occasionally post and share some interesting facts and tidbits that might help others researching lymphoma.  I will title my posts ""More facts and tidbits about lymphoma"".

So here goes...

-The most common symptom of lymphoma is painless enlargement of one or more lymph nodes.  In fact, in over two-thirds of persons with lymphoma, visible enlargement of lymph nodes is the symptom that sends people to the doctor.  In both Hodgkin Lymphoma and NHL, lymph node enlargement is most frequently noticed in the lymph nodes of the neck.  Nodes in the groin and armpit are commonly enlarged in NHL as well.  Slow growing forms of NHL--often called low-grade or indolent NHL--often involve widespread node enlargement affecting multiple nodes.

                Pretty much what it says in the title. I've had swollen lymph nodes in my neck (about 6 of them, small, movable and rubbery) but one appeared under my jaw about  4 months ago (MAYBE due to a wisdom tooth going through gum) and another at the Submandibular gland, 2 months ago or it might be the gland itself that's swelled up but it was painful at first then subsided and now painless but still a bit big and I don't know how it got there. Also, when i go to get up from a chair there's a dull pain at corner of underarm and chest and it's causing slight pains in left arm. Been happening for about 7 months. Think it could be any serious or bad posture

I tried to tell them they needed to do it with me sitting up.  They didn't listen.  Now my Oncologist is having a CT done of it, but says if it shows nothing that he won't do any other test.

It is the weirdest wound strechy white stringy stuff comes out or little yellowish beady balls come out.  it is starting to cause pain going up my arm from time to time and it crunches like the stringy stuff coming out is detaching itself from something inside me: it sounds like a root ripping out of damp dirt in a flower bed, a strong root.Do you know what this maybe.  Could it be a tumor parasite or cancer,  The stringy stuff has a slight order kinda like the white crusty stuff you get off the back of an earring when you take them off after wearing them for a long time.

It seems like I get every cold, flu, virus etc. lately.  Two weeks ago in one of my rare moments where I wasn't in the throws of a sinus or upper respiratory infection, and after having too many cocktails the day before I had a lymph node swell up in my neck. It hurt and I could run my finger across ""the lump"". Went to the Dr. Got a steroid shot and an antibiotic. It went away.  For the past week I have had near debilitating headaches and fatigue.  They seem to subside two days ago.  Yesterday I woke up with a different lymph node all painfully swollen in my jaw AFTER having too many cocktails again.  I got blood work done and my white count was not elevated according to my Dr.  Am I ok?  Should I get another opinion? I don't have itching all over and the first node when away.  I have some sweating at night but it doesn't seem different than other sweating I have had in the past. I still can't help by worry based on stuff I have been reading on the internet.  Please advise.

                I am new to internet forums, so I hope I am doing this correctly. About 6 weeks ago, I developed a ""whole body itch"" that generally affects my chest, neck, scalp, ears. The doctors can not figure out why my body is producing this much histamine. It has been a nightmare!!! At first, I thought I was having a delayed reaction to Macrobid, but after scouring the internet looking for some, any answer, I came across itching as a symotom of lymphoma. I asked my doctor today about it, she casually checked my lymph nodes and replied that my WBC would be elevated (which it was not). Can anyone describe the lymphoma itch to me? Since it appears I am on my own for this one, can you also tell me what other symptoms I might experience (excluding the obvious enlarged lymph nodes)? Thanks so much!!!

                Hi there

For quite some time now, have no idea quite how long as its never been a concern before (possibly over a year/2 maybe?) i've had just 1 hard what i presume to me a lymph node in my neck. Is it located just under my jaw on the left side below the ear. I have to press a finger quite a way in to feel this large lump. It's about the size of a grape, pretty hard and it is moveable slightly from side to side. I've been to docs for bloodwork, all fine no action and i have no symptoms of illness. in fact i've felt pretty good for the past few months. I do however have quite a bit of nasal congestion that will not shift! I am worried it is lymphoma even though my doctor doesn't seem to be concerned but i've seen many cases where people just have 1 swollen lymph node, no symptoms or signs, and have been diagnosed with lymphoma. What should i do? Ignore this and carry on with life or see someone else about it? Could this just be normal for me? I am skinny and also suffer with social anxiety quite a bit.

many thanks!!

                Hi

I have very little knowledge about this disease but if you can help me out that would be nice.
Wanted to understand, if there was a contact with a person who had hiv, and if there was blood involved in sexual orientation, let's say hypothetically a cut with blood was sucked, is this the receiving partner at the risk of leukemia or lymphoma which are both blood diseases...

I have read that docs have difficult time diagnosing this because it develops slowly and many people don't normally get treatment unless mandatory....if above scenario is true, and if normal blood test does not show any kind of abnormality, how does one go about diagnosing issues relating to such concerns

                I am a 29 year old, Caucasian male.  A few months ago, I saw a Dermatologist and tested positive on a nasal swab for MRSA.  He told me that it shouldn't be a big deal and it is just part of my normal flora since I was asymptomatic.  

This past Saturday, I developed a rash on my left shin about the size of my palm.  It does not itch and has not opened up or wept, but is painful to the touch.  It has worsened since it first appeared and is now dark purple/red and spread down to my ankle.  I went to my Family Medicine practitioner first thing Monday morning and he immediately diagnosed it as MRSA, without any cultures.  He took a swab, however, of the outside of the rash and sent it off to be grown.  He prescribed Clindamycin 300mg qid and told me to keep it elevated.  The preliminary results indicate that I definitely have staph, but it might not be MRSA.  He now doesn't seem quite sure what it is and wants to biopsy it, since it still hasn't developed pustules.  Some other symptoms, which I have been experiencing lately are unexplained weight loss to the tune of 35 pounds in the last month.  I also have joint/bone pain and reoccurring flu-like symptoms.  I figure that it is just my body fighting off an infection, but now I'm not sure if it is an infection it is fighting.  Is it possible that the swabs are just picking up the normal Staphylococcus aureus that I've tested positive for in the past?  Would a biopsy be the next step to figuring out what this is on my leg? 

The only pictures I have found online that match what is on my leg are for leukemia.  Is it possible that my doctor is doing to biopsy to check for this?  He didn't seem like was wanted to share his ideas at this moment.  I haven't had recent blood work since this started, but I charted my blood work over the last two years and I have consistently had low MPV, low neutrophils, and high lymphocytes.  Could this be of any use in explaining what is causing my current issue.

Thank you for your time and thoughts.

I also posted this in Dermatology in case it isn't leukemia.

                My 13 year old daughter noticed a lump abover her left clavicle in July. In Aug I had her pediatrician look at it and after reviewing any other causes (illnesses/injury) and checking for other swollenn lymph nodes (there were none), she sent us for lab work.  All was fine, although I was a little concerned that her Immature Granulocytes No was high .04 (range 0.00-0.03) and her Immature Granulocytes was 0.5 (range 0.0-0.5) which is on the higher end. Her sed rate was on the high end of her range as well 17 w/ a range (1-20) with no obvious illness. The lymph node was measured in Aug at 1.0cm by the pediatrician and did not seem to grow over the weeks we watched it.  In October, we had an xray -all was fine. The lymph node at this point did not seem to be growing but was not going away - it is non painful most of the time, occasionaly hard but for the most part, just semi firmish.  My daughter then had an ultrasound and the lymph node was measured at 2.6 with another enlarged lymph node next to it. We met with a surgeon knowing the known lymph node was coming out, but was informed he wants to grab the other one as well.  I realize for children, odds are that she is/ will be fine but I would like an opinion from someone who does not know my daughter or myself and therefore would not feel bad laying out what the chances are of this being a lymphoma.  thank you!!

He told me that he had Herpes simplex on his upper lip and when he went to the doctor, he recommended some kind of corticosteroid ointment and when he didn't respond to them they prescribed Dexamethasone injection (8 of them in 4 days). After 3-4 days his throat begins to swells and it got bigger and bigger since and he started to experience fever and chill afterward.
We decided to take him to a hospital at first they gave him some antibiotics but nothing has change, every doctor comes up with a new diagnosis,one day they say it might be Mononucleosis, then they say it might be Lymphoma or leukemia. 
yesterday they did a biopsy on his neck and they result won't go out until Saturday :( I really don't know what to do? this waiting is killing me ....
He still has his fever and chills, he lost weight but he feels better now. he is just so tired and confused!
Would you please help me with that, what is it really?

                I noticed swollen lymph nodes in groin and neck after having a sexual encounter with a female that I had met at a club. At the time I thought it was an STD but since then have had MANY tests for all the STD's you could think of, results always being negative. I then got told I had sinusitis after being refered to the ear, nose and throat department at the hospital. They gave me blood tests, ultrasound and all the typical tests you would expect for swollen lymph nodes. They said that they could not find anything, however I heard only a biopsy may truly show the issues causing the swollen nodes but all the doctors are convinced there is nothing wrong. When I first discovered the lymph nodes the doctor said yes there definately swollen, then the guy doing the ultrasound said they aren't, but they're bigger then an inch in some places? I also have a few pea sized ones.

Since then my groin is back to normal, however my neck and under my jaw has quite a few swollen lymph nodes which haven't gone away and its been maybe over a year now. I keep going back to the doctors (the last time being yesterday) as I've been told pressuring them is the only way to get them to take action, but they always turn me away like nothing is wrong. I'm so confused, I don't know whether to believe what they're telling me because doctors always have different opinions from other doctors so how can I rely on what one says? I need some advice and facts on lymph nodes because at this moment I'm having a complete breakdown from worry.

                No doctor is listening to me, I already went to the hospital and had scans, bloodwork and all that stuff. The lymph nodes on my neck at the edge of each side of my jaw are REALLY hard. Every GP I've seen says its nothing, but it doesn't feel normal! What could this be? I really want a biopsy but they aren't suggesting it for me!

My daughter runs fever every two weeks for months now she is also fatigued. If her fever is .103+ she vomits. Her
blood work showed a WBC of 25 with high sed rate,crp,and platelets. I don't
remember the exact numbers because I was stunned by her WBC. What could be wrong with her? All bacterial cultures were negative. She has swollen nodes on neck
along with swollen tonsils. Neg strep and throat culture. I do not think this is viral related. We will be see a infectious disease doctor soon but the wait is awful.

                My six month old daughter was recently hospitalized for an extremely elevated WBC( 57.2). They thought leukemia, did a bone marrow and bone biopsy and said that there is nothing showing leukemia, but she does have abnormal cells. The rest of her CBC is this: RBC is low at 3.49, Hgb is 10.4, Hct is low at 29.7, platelet low at 14.4, MPV high at 11.1, Myelocyte high at 3, Lymphocyte low at 34, Monocyte high at 34, Eosinophil high at 6, absolute neutrophil high at 12.0, absolute lymphocyte high at 19.4, absolute monocyte hight at 17.7, absolute eosinophil high at 3.4 and absolute basophil high at 0.6.....she has to go back for more testing, but I'm extremely worried. My mom is a Nurse Practitioner and she doesn't know what it could be. I work with other Nurse Practitioners and Doctors and they're stumped too. Please, if anyone could shed some light on this, I would greatly appreciate it. Also, my daughter does not have a fever or any other signs of infection. The only reason we went to the ER was because she had been projectile vomiting on/off for over a week.

                My daughter has been battling a neck problem for the past 2 years that we know of. She  has had chronic colds, sinus infections. She had bronchitis at 3 mos. which prompted her to be on breathing treatments 3x day for about 6 mos. When she was about 2 she started developing this lump on the mid to right side of her neck. It was about the size of a golf ball under the skin and it actually looked like a goiter. They treated her for it but it has never completely went away now she gets what looks like a fat pad across her neck and it always swells worse when she gets sick. She has had a hard time swollowing her food and is occassionally vomiting. Laryngoscopy, Endoscopy(with biopsy), X-rays show nothing abnormal and her adenoids are only +2. Her blood work shows that her Monocytes are increasing with each blood draw and her lymphocytes are decreasing they're now 54 for monocytes and lymphocytes are 34. Both above and below the ranges and no one has mentioned it. Her RBC and WBC have been fairly normal levels.  They are thinking maybe histoplasmosis but I'm not convinced. She has also had an occassional spike in AST levels. I'm at a loss for where to go next. I am concerned she has a serious underlying medical condition. Should I be concerned her with levels? She has had 4-6 blood draws since Dec. 2010 and the Monocytes are not coming down and the lymphocytes are not coming up. Could this be infection still or something more serious such as cancer? Please help and any suggestions would be appreciated. Thank you.

                About more than an year ago,i was going online when i got to read something about lymph node enlargement online,i checked myself with hands and i noticed that i have a slightly enlarged lymph node on the left side of my neck, and one on the right side aswell,which can be felt with deep pressing,they increased and decreased in size,but remained at around  2 cm long,one was a lil hard and the other was soft and both were moveable,one was a little more moveable....i also noticed that my left tonsil hurt ....however about 2 weeks ago i rechecked and i noticed my tonsil had gotten smaller,and both the lymph nodes have gone smaller and softer...one is around 1 cm long and in diameter also 1 cm,the other may be 1 to 1.5 cm in diameter and length..... but both have definitely gotten much smaller although i can still feel them with deep pressing....also i noticed that during night time they slightly increase and get harder and during morning after i brush they decrease and become softer....
about 1 and a half year ago
(,i had an ultrasound of the neck and the report said no lymphadenopathy seen,normal exam)
....the last time i went to the doctor some months ago she said as long as they are moveable nothing to worry about....maybe i have a hyperactive and sensitive lymph system....i have no difficulty swallowing,no lump in throat,although i do have ibs and gas and that causes my voice to be hoarse sometimes...

My main concern is i read about matted lymph nodes are related to cancer...after the left lymph node in neck decreased in size i noticed just next to it is a rather small pea sized maybe 0.75mm lymph node....

So my question is are 2 matted lymph nodes that are not enlarged and felt after some really deep pressing,a cause for concern for cancer,
And are decreasing lymph nodes in size possibly cancerous in my case?
can matted nodes be caused by strep or other sore throat problem?

I didnot have tuberculosis...but i have had sore throat,possibly strep,with yellow mucus and fever,  which resolved after a course of antibiotics,and painful lymph nodes in neck(the same ones)

*ALL MY BLOOD REPORTS ARE NORMAL and no fever...

Thanks

                Hello! 

I am relatively healthy, 25 years old, female. 

For the past 15 days i've been battling a cold that turned into a sinus infection that was left untreated and led to an ear infection. I am in constant pain; my nose is congested, my ears hurt and i get the worst headaches ever. 

I went to the doctor this morning and he examined me thoroughly. He told me i have sinus infection and ear infection and that my throat is irritated because of post nasal drip and that my neck lymph nodes are swollen. 

The swollen lymph nodes stroke me as particularly odd- i thought they are indicative of a serious infection or cancer. 

My doctor seemed to be more alarmed about my ears than about my lymph nodes 
He prescribed antibiotics, 500 mg of Ceclor 3 times a day and a nasal spray that disinfects the nasal canals. 

I am in panic now though. Why are my lymph nodes swollen? 

Could it be a symptom of lymphoma? 

Can sinus infections/ear infections really cause swollen nodes?

Before starting the Rituxin, had pet scan and it was only showing in the neck.
He's been starting to also feel itchy all over which in reading on NHL that itching is one of the side effects.  He has other health issues, he's 84. His overall health is not so great.
Has another dr appointment next week, but am curious as to what to expect, being the cancer has come back and his health is not so good.  Will he be able to beat this again?

                Okay so I’m after a bit of advice.

About three months ago I went to the doctor as I was extremely fatigued and thirsty. Around that time I had been feeling some discomfort in my chest/lung area and occasionally pain. Also during this time and up until about a week ago I had been experiencing what I guess is night sweats, I wouldn't wake up to (nothing wakes me up) but every morning I could smell sweat on my clothes and only once or twice I was covered in sweat, but never thought anything of it, even though it was winter/spring time. I had a blood test taken to check my blood sugar and a few other things (don't remember what) and all my doctor said was I don’t have diabetes. He also checked my breathing but said absolutely nothing. Soon all symptoms went away.

About a week ago I found a lump on my neck under my ear. I don't think it is noticeable and it is quite soft and painless. The pain in my lungs has returned, although worse. Right now I am sitting on my couch and feeling slight pain. I can't get comfortable. My upper back has also been annoying me, it starts to hurt for no apparent reason, however if I sit down and lean my back against something it does feel better. Yesterday I walked up about 20 stairs and I got slightly puffed. I'm really tired again, and generally feel like crap. I had already been taking iron tablets.

Should I go back to my doctor, and what should I do again if he doesn't find anything wrong again. Is it worth worrying about, or should I try a different doctor? I don’t want to go in there sounding like a hypochondriac but I want to find whatever is wrong, if at all. I haven’t been sick recently and have no explanation as to why I would have what I suspect is a swollen lymph node. 
Also I should add that I am 18 and female.

                Hello!

I am a relatively healthy 25-year old female. I don't smoke, I don't drink alcohol and I try to lead a healthy lifestyle. I have no family history of Leukemia/Lymphoma. I've had Infectious Mononucleosis when I was 16 years old, the antibodies are still detected in my bloodstream so I suppose I can't get it again (right?).

Last week, I shaved my armpits and put deodorant on right away. It stang and the following day I woke up with a sore and itchy rash under both armpits. I could see that my shaving had also caused two tiny cuts under my left underarm. I tried using my deodorant less and I abstained from shaving for 4 days. 

Then, on Friday (3 days ago), I decided to shave them again. The rash wasn't inflammed, it had just left my armpits scaly and dry. I waited for 2-3 hours after shaving before putting deodorant.

On Saturday and Sunday (the day before yesterday and yesterday) my armpits (especially the left one) felt rather itchy so I didn't shave, I just put deodorant on.

This morning, I noticed that I have the pink rash again on my left underarm. To make matters worse, it is itchy and I can detect a tiny little lump where my two cuts used to be. It is not exactly visible but when I press it with my finger, I can feel something harder under the surface of the skin. The shaving cuts have healed so there's no scar, just the redness of the rash and a tiny lump (about the size of a nut). The rash is itchy and stings and the lump feels painful when I put pressure on it.

I have no insurance right now. I called my doctor and told him the whole story and he is of the opinion that the skin irritation has caused the lump and the pain. He told me that lymphoma causes larger lumps that are painful to the touch. Also, he said that it is usually accompanied by other symptoms such as fatigue, fevers, anorexia etc.

I am not convinced though.

Can something so simple as a skin irritation because of deodorant/shaving cause a lump?

I am scared to death and I don't know how to treat it.

                on the first weeks of October my throat started to itch, it wasn’t that bad, yet two days later my neck’s left side enlarged, I think the medical term for that is “Lymphadenopathy”, so I went to see a doctor and he gave me antibiotics(forgot the name). I didn’t take it as I should have, I forgot sometimes , and I did drink while taking them. It took some time until the enlargement went down, but instead too nodes appeared! I was scared that it might be something worse that just an infection, so after a while I went to see a doctor he gave me antibiotics again for 10 days (forgot to take twice), and sent me to do some blood tests, I came back after two weeks, he said that the nodes are smaller now, though I think they closer not smaller, and in my test result it showed that I had EBV virus, and underneath it said that I have EBV past infection I think. Yet he said that he is not completely sure so he thinks I should come back in two weeks. Oh and I’m havin this upper back pain(it could be from many reason’s) that I’m connecting to the EBV virus, I almost forot last week my left side’s throat(only my left side) was a bit painful.

                I've had quite the long medical journey in the past year, but I still don't have any definitive diagnosis on what's going on with me. I'm going to try and keep this short since my question is mainly about the numbers (bloodwork). For reference, I'm a 22 year-old female.

I became really sick last March/April, and it appeared to be hormonal. It took a year, but I was finally given a preliminary diagnosis of Hashimoto's thyroiditis, or autoimmune hypothyroidism, a few weeks ago even though I have no antibodies (90 - 95% of these cases do). I've also been given diagnoses of obstructive sleep apnea (no obstruction found), ""migraines"" and transient ischemic attacks, a large, benign pineal cyst, environmental allergies, and most recently, elevated liver enzymes, anemia, and marked sinus bradycardia.

Now that it sounds like I'm a medical mess, I guess it'd be hard for you to imagine me being healthy, for the most part, just a mere year-and-a-half ago, wouldn't it? Well, I really used to be.....

My questions are: what bloodwork is typically abnormal for leukemia and/or lymphoma patients? Being concerned--but not overly focused--on my recently poor health has made me notice a few trends with my bloodwork since I started getting a lot of it done, in June 2008. The testing was generally done at the same facility, or by the same lab service and when I pointed out the trends to my GP, she admitted that most doctors don't pay attention to the overall trends or relationships of the blood tests, but instead just look to see if the values are ""normal"". The trends (over the course of 5 CBC's) that I've noted with my blood are:

--decreasing RBC count (the last count was ""low"")
--decreasing hematocrit (the last value was ""low"")
--increasing RDW
--increasing WBC count (in June 2008 my levels were ~5; they increased to 7.5 over time)
--increasing lymphocytes (still within normal range)
--increasing neutrophils (still within normal range)
--increasing monocytes (still within normal range)
--increasing eosinophils (still within normal range)
--decreasing basophils (still within normal range/almost non-existent)
--elevated ALT and AST (""high"")
--many other borderline values (as in, one unit away from being ""low"" or ""high""), including:
--low-normal bilirubin
--high-normal creatinine
--high-normal sodium
--low-normal hemoglobin

Is it odd for these trends to be occurring, especially if my doctors assume I have autoimmune diseases (allergies, Hashimoto's)? Does any of this seem worrisome from the perspective of positive indicators for leukemia/lymphoma in the bloodwork?

I believe my groin lymph nodes have been swollen for some time now, but I could never get a doctor interested enough in palpating them...and I didn't really speak up about them too much after two doctors ignored me. I had a CT scan of my chest to my adrenals done and ""no significant lymphadenopathy"" was noted in July 2008. I was having night sweats and randomly getting low-grade fevers, which I still kind of do (I haven't been monitoring my temperature much anymore and I don't really wake up at night since I sleep like a rock from the fatigue). I've been feeling incredible fatigue, occasional dizziness and orthostatic hypotension, lack of concentration, motivation, or interest in most things, headaches, joint aches and pains, edema, abdominal discomfort and soreness, and visible dimpling/lumpiness in my breasts that my gynecologist didn't comment on. Sometimes the low-grade fevers will be accompanied with an obvious flushing of my face, arms, and chest, but doesn't appear to be a rash. I had a swollen spleen and enlarged liver over the summer, but no doctor has commented on this since, although I have felt abdominal fullness, tenderness, and pain (particularly in the upper left and right quadrants) ever since. Notably, the CT scan of my chest showed some weird conglomeration of material near my right armpit, but the radiologist didn't note anything. I'd actually really appreciate it if someone could look at my CT scan pictures in my profile, because I haven't been able to get anyone to really comment on them; I've even circled the odd areas.

My great-aunt (blood relation) had acute lymphoblastic leukemia in her 70s and my grandmother (another side, also blood relation) had colorectal or small-bowel cancer as did one of her sons, my uncle, in their early 50s. I'm not sure if this is useful information, but I figured it couldn't hurt. I'm just really confused about how I feel soooo terrible but none of my hormone levels have come back being abnormal, and the one that does come back abnormal occasionally (the TSH for my thyroid) hasn't gotten much elevated in a year's time, and it isn't necessarily even elevated enough to be causing all of my symptoms! My endocrinologist was kind of stumped but put me on a trial of thyroid medication, anyway. It doesn't seem to be doing anything for me.....none of my female relatives have autoimmune thyroid disease, either, which is odd...my mom is getting tested for it, though.

Thanks for your help!

on the first weeks of October my throat started to itch, it wasn’t that bad, yet two days later my neck’s left side enlarged, I think the medical term for that is “Lymphadenopathy”, so I went to see a doctor and he gave me antibiotics(forgot the name). I didn’t take it as I should have, I forgot sometimes , and I did drink while taking them. It took some time until the enlargement went down, but instead too nodes appeared! I was scared that it might be something worse that just an infection, so after a while I went to see a doctor he gave me antibiotics again for 10 days (forgot to take twice), and sent me to do some blood tests, I came back after two weeks, he said that the nodes are smaller now, though I think they closer not smaller, and in my test result it showed that I had EBV virus, and underneath it said that I have EBV past infection I think. Yet he said that he is not completely sure so he thinks I should come back in two weeks. Oh and I’m havin this upper back pain(it could be from many reason’s) that I’m connecting to the EBV virus, I almost forot last week my left side’s throat(only my left side) was a bit painful.

                I have had a problem with a surgical belly button healing. I had emergency surgery on 24th October 2011 done laproscopic with three wound sites. The other tow sites healed but my belly button healed. I had swabs taken which showed coliform and had been on 4 different antibiotics. I then got sent for a CT scan which showed I had an umbilical hernia so got operated on the 19th December to sort wound out and repair hernia which was only done through belly button. On Christmas Eve it re-opened an swap showed staph areus and coliform so was put on oral antibiotics which didn't work so was admitted for IV antibiotics which closed the wound but after getting home from hospital it re-opened and was put on oral antibiotics which did nothing. My gynaecologist consultant who had done the operations didn't know what to do so I got referred to a general surgeon who took a swab and I am having a MRI scan. I saw my G.P today as I am really not feeling well. My gynaecologist took some bloods done on the 12th January which showed my CRP was 18mg/l and my eosinophils are elevated but in december when I had bloods done everything was normal as far as I know. I am getting checked out for lymphoma and see my haematologist next Monday but am wondering is the crp from my wound infection or if I have lymphoma could it possible to do with that. I have had my crp tested loads of time and the highest it has ever gone up is to 3mg/l and I have also had this wound infection since Oct so why has it taken my crp to go up so slowly when it was normal in December.

I would really appreciate your help

Kind Regards

                I had a bloodtest about 2 weeks ago. My WBC is a little bit low, and the report says i have mild leucopenia.  1blood count are as follows:

WBC 4.2 (4.5-11.0)
Neutrophil 59% (40 - 75)
Lymphocyte 36% (20 - 45)
Monocyte 2% (2 - 10)
Eosinophil 2% (0 - 6)
Basophil 1% (0 - 2)

Everything seems to be within the range except WBC. RBC, haemoglobin and platelet count are all within the range.

Back in 2007 when i have my bloodtest done, same thing actually happened. Everything was in normal range except WBC 3.9 (4.5 - 13.0) and lymphocyte 47% (25 - 45).

WBC was low in both test (year 2007 and 2011). Is there any problem with that? 

I do not remember anything back then in 2007, but this year, on the night after the blood has been withdrawn, I experienced yeast infection at genital. Days before the blood was taken, I had 2 ulcers in mouth and swollen glands under the jaw. 

I'm concern about my health.

                In mid November 2011 I went to my doctor for treatment and antibiotics for a severe cough I could not get rid of. At that time she noted that my left lyphm gland was enlarged but thought it was due to the cough and thought the antibiotics would take care of this. She had ask me if  I had noticed this swollen gland before but I had never noticed it and don't have any idea how long it had been this way.  At 2 week intervals she had me come back and noted that after a month the lyphm gland had not returned to normal. At this time I was sent for a CT scan, which showed the enlarged gland, and was referred to a Ear nose and Throat specialist.  He noted the enlarged gland and perfomed a needle biopsy, which he did say at the time that the needle biopsy might not show anything that he does not already know which is the it is a lyphm gland and that it is swollen. I am scheduled for another CT scan in 2 weeks, to which he noted that if the gland is still showing up on the scan as swollen he is recommending having the swollen part of the gland surgically removed and tested to make sure no cancer is present.  Is this standard procedure for this type of issue.  I feel fine, have no loss of weight or energy at this time. I am a 54 year old male that does not smoke or chew snuff.

                Yesterday, while driving, I felt a dull pain on the right side of my neck. I ran my hand/fingers over the area and felt a lump or a mass. A swollen area. I am a 40 y/o female with type 2 diabetes, and overweight. Other than cholesterol and the previously stated I am otherwise healthy. I think. From trying to understand, I found a site that gives you some common reasons for a swollen lymph node depending on the location of the lymph node. From a photo, I estimated the location of this mass to be Posterior cerrvical  lymph node. The web site is http://www.medicalgeek.com/disease-syndromes-procedures/7026-causes-cervical-neck-lymph-node-enlargement.html

According to this site, the common reason for a swollen node in this site could be lymphoma or TB. I am freaking out! 

I have minimal pain in the area but I am not sure if it us pain do to messing with it or pain do to the node itself. The mass can not be easily moved. It is not hard loke a stone but i would not say it is ribbery in texture either. It is firm. It is about the size of a dime, maybe a nickel. When I tilt my 
head to tbe left, it is visible by looking in the 
mirror. 

I sometimes have a bit of night sweats but I have always chalked this up to irregular breathing/snoring when I sleep. However, it is usually very minimal sweats and I feel hot. 

I always have this feeling if impending doom do to a lot if tragedy in my life. Please forgive me if you feel I  overly anxious about this. 

If anyone could share insight I would appreciate it. 

Thank You,
Michelle

                Hi all.  I am a 39 yo female and just recently put two and two together and started freaking out.
First of all, for at least 3 years (i can't recall exactly when it started) every single time I drink any type of alcohol, within 1-2 minutes after one sip I get this deep, dull pain in the left side of my chest and neck and in my left shoulder and upper arm.  Once it starts coming on, it increases for about a minute, peaks for about a minute and then slowly fades away after about 10 minutes or so.  I get this pain even if I take a dose of Nyquil.  It varies in severity, but it happens to some extent every time I ingest one sip of alcohol.  Sometimes it is so bad that I just have to stop what I'm doing and breathe through it.  Sometimes I can just ignore it.  The type of alcohol I drink doesn't seem to be related to the severity of the pain.  And I can continue drinking and not have any pain once it has come and gone after that first sip.
So this has been going on for 3 years and I haven't thought much about it, since it always goes away and it hasn't gotten worse and it hasn't killed me yet.  But recently, just out of curiosity, I decided to search the internet to see if other people had that weird experience, because nobody I know personally had.  All I could find that matched my experience was Hodgkin's Lymphoma.  Immediately, it came to mind this follow-up CT that I have been putting off for 3 years.  I had a CT done 3 years ago for abdominal pain.  Incidentally, the CT showed that I have four lesions on my spleen.  My doctor told me most lesions on the spleen are benign and not to worry unless I start having other symptoms and to follow up in 3 to 6 months for a repeat CT.  Well, so much other stuff in life happened in the last 3 years, I just never followed up.  
Now, I'm just scared to death.  I can't go to the doctor yet, because I am switching insurance in January.  If I go to the doctor now and it IS lymphoma, the new insurance won't cover it, because it will be a ""pre-existing condition"".  So I just have to wait.  I do have a couple of small palpable lymph nodes on the left side of my neck, but I don't think they're big enough to worry about, but with the other stuff, I'm kind of starting to worry.
Does anyone know, is it even possible to have Hodgkins for years without knowing it??   Is there some other issue that can cause that kind of alcohol pain?

                Hopefully this is in the right place. I think it is...

Here is my problem/question. My lymph nodes in my neck (the ones right under your jaw) do not feel evenly sized. I believe they are called the submandibular nodes. Anyways, on the left side of my neck, they seem fine. I can feel them/it, but they are sort of tucked away, and feel about the size of a pea. They are easily moveable, don't hurt, and sort of ""pop"" when I push in on them/it. 

However, oppositely, on the right side of my neck - this same submandibular node does NOT feel the same. It feels larger and flatter. It's more pronounced, and isn't really as tucked away as the one on the other side of my neck. Maybe about 2x the size of the of the one on the left, and much ""flatter"" to the touch. It's not bulging or anything, and nobody would even be able to notice it if they didn't feel it. But to me, because I can feel it and compare, it is not the same as the other side.

I've been trying to research this on the internet, but haven't found anything worthwhile. I was really sick with strep over this past summer for 3 days (white spots in throat, couldn't swallow, high fever, night sweats, aches, etc.), but haven't been sick since. This node has been like this for what I'd say is months, maybe even longer. 

I probably wouldn't notice it if I wasn't a hypochondriac.  I've done some research on what enlarged nodes could mean, and none of the outcomes are good.

I haven't noticed any other enlarged nodes or glands on my body. Like I said, it doesn't hurt, it's pretty easily moveable and somewhat squishy.  But the size/shape has be a bit concerned.

Should I be concerned?  Any input/insight/advice would be appreciated.

Thank you

I've never used this site before so I maybe in the wrong area... its so unclear...

Basically, I have a grossly enlarged spleen. I have been for an ultrasound and I'm seeing a haematologist this weekend. I have lost about 1 stone in weight in the last two months. The left side of my abdomen is solid from my ribs down to below my belly button. I'm finding it increasingly difficult to breath. No one is able to tell me what these symptoms may or may not mean - I'm getting really worried. Can anyone help me understand the possibilities? Can you live without a spleen? What does it do? Why is it so massive? I've stopped drinking alcohol all together and I quit smoking about 1month ago - should I be doing anything else?

Thanks for reading this.

                I am very worried, and would be grateful for any thoughts good or bad.

In late November, I felt a burning pain in my abdomen, which gradually moved downward to the left side.  After a very acidic bowel movement, the pain remained.  I went to the emergency room after a couple days, was admitted to the hospital, and was diagnosed with sigmoiditis with a perforation (lower left colon), which I was told sealed itself off.  I went home after a few days and was on Flagyl and Cipro for several more.  

Now when I eat, even if I feel very hungry at first, I will sometimes become full after eating fairly little.  And when I feel too full, I feel horrible and woozy.  At my follow up appointment, my gastroenterologist looked at my CT scan and said it looked like diverticulitis.  

I have had a 1 cm lump behind my right earlobe for several months at least.  A week ago, a second pea-sized lump swelled up right beneath the first one and my back and sides started itching in the shower.  However, I am not losing weight, I do not have night sweats, and I am not running a fever.

Does this look like lymphoma of the abdomen?  Or do you think the lumps and colon issues are unrelated?  I've also noticed that my right ear (with the lumps behind it) has not produced anywhere near as much earwax as my left ear lately.  Could there be some sort of clog that's leading to swollen lymph nodes?

I am seeing an ENT on Wednesday morning, and I will ask for a biopsy, but in the meantime I am very concerned.  Thanks so much for your help.

                I'm not even sure where to start with all this. First of all I'm a 40yr old female. I have no idea if any of this is related at all but giving the info. anyhow. When I was 3yrs old (I know long time ago lol) I had large lymph nodes in my neck. I remember very clearly because of how the Dr. wanted to check my temp. haha Anyhow, my mom has a photo where I lost almost all of my hair on the one side. The nodes in my neck went down and my hair grew back and life went on. On and off over the years I'd get sore throats and what I thought were swollen glands. Nothing bad or anything to see a Dr. for and it would go away. In my early 20's I started with fatigue and started seeing a Dr. they kept testing me for Lupus which still to this day is negative. The fatigue went on up until about 37yrs old when it seems all hell broke lose.  My Dr. had assumed by symptoms I had MS. which should give you an idea of my symptoms. My brain MRI was neg. and we're now doing B12 shots and I take Vitamin D since that was also very low. I have in the past 2yrs been tested for everything under the sun! Lymes, Celiac, Hep, HIV you name it.... My lymph nodes in my neck (under my jaw area) are constantly swelling but they do go down, just to swell back up again. This is the only place I have noticed swollen lymph nodes. My last WBC could was high, nothing outrageous crazy high but high enough that she is concerned. I have night sweats, a cough that seems to never leave and yes I am a smoker but even she says it doesn't seem related since my lungs sound clear. Also it is a dry cough. I also from time to time have very bad issues with swallowing. My weight has been up and down over the past few months. I also have petechiae on my one arm since I'm little, from my wrist to elbow (yes it is all over my arm) and have noticed it in other places but only a very little.

Went to the Dr. today and she felt a lump in my left side. So, she wants me to have a neck and chest x-ray, more blood work to check my wbc count again. And see a ENT. Only other thing found in any of my blood work was protein in my urine. And larger rbc's but my platelet count and rbc counts are fine etc.

I know nothing at all about Lymphoma or Leukemia. Can it possibly go on this long??? What type of questions should I ask??? I feel soooo lost. I'm of course not trying to let this bother me and so far have been doing great, but not knowing if we're going in the right direction, what to ask or know doesn't make things to easy :)

Any help would be appreciated.

                My daughter has been intermittently sick since early October. She is tired, pale, and has abdominal pain (that turns out to be a swollen liver and spleen) that lasts approximately 2 days, and then goes away for 1-3 weeks. In November, her pediatrician diagnosed her with mono. However, I am skeptical, given there is no guarantee she contracted EBV this year or that it is responsible for these symptoms, and the liver pain keeps coming back instead of getting better. 

She has had complete blood counts and liver and kidney enzyme tests 4 times, and all tests have been normal. Right before Christmas she had a sudden headache with visual disturbances. I took her to the ER. She had a CAT scan that was normal, and was diagnosed with a migraine. Two days ago her liver pain came back, (though she did not tell me) and she has also has headaches, though not as bad as the migraine.

I am very concerned, but the last time I took her to her pediatrician's office a nurse examined her and the pediatrician dismissed my concerns, saying, ""she has mono"".

                I posted a couple of months back about the doctors querying lymphoma after they found lymph nodes were large when I had a CT head and neck when I came down with meningitis. I had needle aspirated biopsy which failed and results were inconclusive. Doctors decided that if it was due to infection, they would do an ultra sound neck scan a month later and if enlarged nodes were due to infection, they should have gone down by then.

A month passed and I had my USS neck and the radiographer told me that the nodes had not gone down at all. I was due to see my consultant a month later and he re referred me back to ENT. Consultant wanted ENT to do lymph node biopsy and the next day I saw ENT who decided they would do the biopsy. So on Friday I had an operation to have a lymph node removed for biopsy. Before the op the ENT surgeon said I had a really, really, lumpy neck and joked that he was spoiled for choice to decide which node to remove. After the op surgeon came round and told me the lymph node he removed was the size of a golf ball which I don't think anyone was expecting. This kinda alarmed me and I am now so worried. I will find out if I have lymphoma or not on Thursday.

I don't know what I am expecting from posting this. I am just feeling upset and scared I guess. I don't know if I am looking for reassurance or if golf ball sized nodes meant that something is wrong. :(

                Hi and thank you for taking the time to review my question. My daughter is 16 yrs old and became ill with what we thought was the respiratory flu about 4 weeks ago. She has had continuing symptoms that have me concerned. Her primary symptom is a hacking cough, that leads her to gag. Her GP gave her Augmentin which has not helped and has caused diarrhea.
 She is also consistently fatigued, has night sweats, is losing weight (no appetite) and last night some rectal bleeding (bright red and small amount) for the first time ever. She has seen our GP who said her lungs are clear and she has no swollen lympnodes.
About 4 months ago she was hospitalized with acute appendicitis the cbc revealed normal values except for elevated lymphocytes. They asked if she had recently been sick, which she had not. I am obviously concerned that we may be looking at leukemia here. I have scheduled her to have a complete CBC and chest xray. What specifically should I be looking for on the CBC? I would assume if she has mono that her WBC's will be elevated..Please advise when you have a moment...we are very worried.
Thank you.

                Approx 3 months ago I noticed a small lymph node on the left side of my neck (measured 9mm). I havent been sick at all. I also have a very tiny lymph node I can feel in my left armpit that moves very easily. I immediadtely went to my doctor, had 3 CBC's done everything normal. Then I had a chest xray done and it came back clear nothing abnormal. I also had an ultrasound done to check my neck lymph node which was measured at (9mm) and a few more that were much smaller (2mm) same side of neck. The doctor said the lymph node didn't appear abnormal on the ultrasound and that they can usually tell by appearance of the node if its cancerous (is this true??). I honestly feel fine I have started with body itching especially at night but  the winter months have just begun so I dont know if its from the furnace being on and the dry air. I am having huge anxiety and I know its causing me extreme stress. I am constantly searching online and reading symptoms. My fatigue I believe is caused from my anxiety and not sleeping. This week I will be having an abdominal ultrasound if this comes back clear of no abnormalities can I put this behind me? The doctor said usually with lymphoma the nodes are 2cm and bigger and look ""mean"" on an ulreasound. Please I need advice I feel as though I will have a nervous breakdown.

                I would like to start out saying I'm not a hypochondriac. 

I have been anemic for MONTHS. I have been on iron and vitamin c for 6 months, and i continue to get more anemic. My iron, hmg (i think right letters), and rbc keep dropping. But everything else is normal.

I'm a 21 year old female, 140 pounds, 5'7. I have lost some weight recently (only ten pounds in like 2 months), nothing major. I'm on bc so I only get 4 periods a year. I used to donate blood a lot and still be okay- I've been too anemic to donate so I haven't in the 6 months. I'm always tired and out of breath but that's from anemia right?

I also keep getting bruising on my legs (mainly my knees) when I'm pretty sure I haven't hit them or anything.  

So can a cbc only show anemia with leukemia, I feel like I'm not getting anywhere with my doctors I have no idea whats going on. I feel so tired it's getting in the way of my life.

                Hi, my daughter age 7 first started being ill this time last year- lethargic, nosebleeds, pale,leg pain, fevers, swollen lymph glands. She was admitted to hospital after an abnormal blood count,platlets low, white blood count high and her neutrophils were 0.32- very low. We were told either to expect mono or at the worst bone marrow displasia or even leukemia. Her spleen was very inlarged. We finally got a diagnosis of EBV, she had every blood test known including aauto immune disorders. And we did have to keep having repeat blood counts until they went back to normal. Then this year I noticed a swelling on her left breast, she was also acting very sensitive and moody. Her doctor suspected precocious puberty and referred us to an endocrinologist who has up to now done a bone xray which was normal but confirmed she has developed in some areas consistant with puberty. She is scheduled for hormone tests next week and an mri scan which we dont have the appointment for yet. Now for the past 3 weeks she has been very poorly. Random fevers again, leg pain again, very pale and huge swollen lymph glands on her neck and groin. We were told she had a virus. Then she had really bad mouth sores which again was diagnosed as a virus. We went to see a different doctor and she gave us antibiotics which did seem to help for a couple of days but then the fever returned. We went to see our gp again this week and he sent us to the hospital for a full blood count- which was normal. The past two days she has been well and been back in school but now today the fever has come back again and she is very pale, bruised eyes and very prominent veins are showing on her skin. Any one have any ideas??? I know its not leukemia and we would have know by now, we know its not any immune disorder because she has been tested. Im now thinking lymphoma? But would the blood count come back abit wacko? Im thinking 3-4 weeks of random fevers and mouth sores and swollen glands isnt normal or am i just panicking? any info appreciated, thanks u :)

                I am trying not to freak out here so I'm hoping someone can help. Here is my history. In June of this year (5 months ago), I was experiencing extreme pain and tightness under the rib cage that eventually made me nauseous and unable to eat. After 2 weeks of no improvement and a diagnosis of GERD from my family dr, i drove myself to the ER. After 6 hours there, they diagnosed me with ""Mesenteric Lymphadenitis"" after an ultrasound and CT scan of my lower abdomen, gave me percocet, pepcid and zofran for nausea and had me follow up with a surgeon to check my gall bladder. After the surgeon pretty much said he didn't know why they told me to go see him, I was frustrated and never went back from my follow up blood tests with my GP.

The dr's office tried to get a hold of me for a couple months but I was dodging them as I was mad that my diagnoses were all over the board. Plus, the symptoms subsided for the most part. Finally, my GP called my Mom (my emergency contact) and freaked her out enough where she finally convinced me to at least get the follow up bloodwork done. 

less than 40 hours after my bloodwork, I get a call from my GP's office saying my WBC count is 11.7, which is high but not alarmingly so. They scheduled an appointment a week after to do a full CBC to check my levels. My WBC count increased to 12.8 in just a week and I have no symptoms or signs of infection. The only symptoms I have are severe leg pain that I have had for a couple years now and extreme fatigue - both of which have gotten worse over the past 6 months. The pressure under my rib cage is back and my lymphs in my neck are slightly swollen but do not hurt, but I am sleeping 12-13 hours a night and am still exhausted the next day and my leg pain is intolerable at this point. 

The results of my CBC are as follows: my WBC count is 12.8, my lymphocytes are 4260 and my eosinophils are 2148 - all high. The Dr called me the next day after I received the CBC and told me to make an appointment right away with a specific Oncologist/Hematologist, mentioning that my counts could indicate leukemia when I asked. I have an appointment with him next week. 

Any insight into what could be wrong with me would be great.

                1.  There are about 6 subtypes of Hodgkin lymphoma and 61 subtypes of Non Hodgkin lymphoma. 

2.  Lymphoma usually develops when a genetic error, or mutation, occurs within a lymphocyte, causing the abnormal cell to duplicate faster than a normal cell or live longer than a normal lymphocyte.

3.  Approximately 70% of people diagnosed with NHL are 50 years old or more; they are more likely to be men than women; and they are more likely to be Caucasion than African-American.

4.  Lymphoma is more common among people with depressed immune systems and those exposed to environmental carcinogens, pesticides, herbicides, viruses and certain bacteria.  Risk for developing lymphoma may be higher in individuals who:
   -have a family history of NHL
   -are affected with an autoimmune disease
   -have received an organ transplant
   -have been exposed to chemicals such as pesticides, fertilizers or 
    organic solvents for a long period.
   -have been infected with viruses such as Epstein-Barr (which causes 
    mononucleosis), human T-lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1), 
    HIV/AIDS, or certain bacteria such as H.pylori.

                I have noticed that I have had enlarged lymph nodes for a week or so now.. It had been both sides at one point. Now, however, the larger node has remained and the left sided one is no longer swollen. They were not painful.
The larger one has now swelled to about double it's swollen size before. It was painful and tender when I woke up this morning when I lifted my head and the skin pulled. If I tilt my head to the right and lift my shoulder I can locate and feel the pain. As for right now, It is not painful unless I press on it. 

I have had some very bad night sweats recently, for about 4/5 days in a row. I would wake up and my pajamas be soaked (and I would be freezing). This was the first night that I did not have a night sweat, but I woke up with a lymph node double in size and seemingly hurting from swelling. At the onset of night sweats, I had felt very fatigued and nauseous. I would also shake. I assumed I had the flu.

This past year has been hard for me as I was treated for major depression and anxiety. I have been taken anti depressants and anxiety medication for a year now. I was experiencing major brain fog and had poor concentration, which made me very, very, depressed and seek medical help for it. Prior to the brain fog, I do not feel like I was depressed. I have always been proud of my success in school, so when I did a 180 it was devastating. After a year of antidepressants I do not feel like my brain fog has been removed. I feel like they may have brought some amount of clarity, but by no means brought me back up to my full potential. I have lost weight most likely due to my recent lack of appetite. I have no desire to eat and seem to forget to do so at times. Which, probably contributes to my poorly functioning memory/concentration. I try my best to eat, but without feeling hunger it somehow has moved down on my priority list. I have also been experiencing hair loss, which I assumed was due to depression/anxiety/stress and iron deficiency anemia. 
When I was very younger I had cyclical neutropenia, but since that was so long ago I imagine that has little to no relevance now as an adult (20 years old).

I apologize for the long winded medical history.

Does this sound like it could be lymphoma? Or am I looking at a cyst?

                I am a teenager and found a lump in my abdomen a little over two weeks ago. There was also a lot of swelling around my entire stomach. The lump was hard and tender to the touch. I also presented with other symptoms such has low grade fevers (on and off), night sweats, difficulty breathing, loss of appetite, nausea, fatigue, and the list goes on. I went to the ER on Sunday after the lump got larger and the swelling was becoming worse. My ER doctor ran a CBC (complete blood count) and a CT on my chest and abdomen. Both came back normal but he told me he was still concerned about Lymphoma and that the CT ""maybe"" could have missed it. He said he was going to treat it as an infection with antibiotics and if the lump hadn't gone away in a week, I'd need a biopsy. I came home and I began to feel one hundred times worse, it was unbearable. We called the hospital I had went to earlier in the day and they thought I would need to be admitted so they suggested I go to the children's hospital. I went, and got a brand new intern as my doctor, who refused to do anymore tests or listen to a word I said. She did the same CBC and sent me home. Last night, I found a new lump in my lower abdomen. It was hard also and tender to the touch. I also had pain on my sides and in my neck. I went to my general practitioner, who as I expected, didn't listen to me. She didn't want me to get a biopsy, and totally blew me off. She did do more blood work though - another CBC, something else and a LDH. She said ""if"" something alarming was found in my blood work, we'd do an ultrasound. She also told me they found fluid in my abdomen (which I didn't know before). I am becoming aggravated with doctors and not being listened to… as I know my own body and know that something is not right. Has anyone here dealt with symptoms like this or doctors of this nature? Any suggestions?

Thanks!

                 Hi, a few months back I was diagnosed with tonsilitis and the treatment there was all fine. I recently realised my right tonsil and lymph node were swollen with cold symptoms and was told I have tonsilitis again and I am now on antibiotics. Blood test for glandular fever came back negative. My concern is that my swollen tonsil and lymph node may have been like this for a long time without realisation and I have also seen dark spots on my tonsil now that I am on the medication but have read that it is a good sign showing that it is working. I am 15 years old and I am silly enough to search up everything, and the whole lymph node/tonsil swelling thing leads me to lymphoma and cancer. Should I be worried about this right now? the only other symptoms is a little fatigue but only happens after hardly any sleep so there is reason. No night sweats, still eating normal, and no weight loss and feeling fine. Doc says that if problems with lymph node persist I will get an ultra sound. Is that a good option? Forgot to add that both tonsil/lymph node are not painful and dont give me any problems.Ill be happy to give any more info.

Thanks

At this point, I have had five treatments. After only three treatments, the pain in the area where the lymph nodes were swollen decreased, actually went away.  The doctor seemed surprised, and she also did not think that I have had enough radiation treatment to give me side effects either.  Anyone else had experience with this?  My fatigue is severe and I am not attributing this to the radiation, but I have had an upset stomach since my fifth treatment.  I never know what to expect anymore.

                Over the past months I had bloodwork, CT scans, ultrasound and a couple more things. They said they found nothing and the specialists who did the ultrasound said they were near enough normal size, its just because I'm very slim. However I'm still worried without a biospy that I could end up with something very bad? The lymph nodes are are in my neck, tiny ones in my groin and maybe one under my armpit (the specialist said there is just more blood flow under my armpit?).

                I recently had a 10 day stint in hospital after I became extremely unwell. Severe headache, photophobia, vomiting, had a temp of 39.8 or something stupid like that. They suspected meningitis but also queried a thrombosis in my brain so I went for a CT head and neck, came back fine except the radiologist was concerned about the size of my lymph nodes. I had an ultrasound guided lymph node biopsy taken which came back inconclusive as the sample size was too small. I also had a lumbre puncture which tested positive for protein and showed raised LDH. My bloods also showed low neutrophils, raised ESR and CRP (I think, one might have been down and the other might have been up I forgot). I understand that these are symptoms of meningitis which they think was the initial problem but after looking up what LDH was (because I didn't know and am a student nurse) it is also a symptom of some cancers which. Anyway, because the first biopsy was unsuccessful the medics referred me to the surgeons so they could take the biopsy and both the medics and consultant surgeon could feel my cervical nodes up straight away without much feeling around for them. So they referred me to ENT to take the biopsies but because they weren't bulging out like goiters they refused to take a biopsy. So instead I have to wait 3 weeks for another ultrasound on my neck with possible biopsies if lymphs are still enlarged then get the results on 23rd November. Reason for the delay is cos possibly the lymphs are extremely large because of having a beast of an infection and should go down within that time span. Also all the doctors commented about the size of my tonsils. I did have tonsillitis about 2 months ago which was treated with anti biotics but I have absolutely no pain in them at all but today I have noticed they feel funny when I swallow, like they are resisting against me swallowing. No pain at all.

I don't really have any symptoms except the raised lymph nodes in my neck. I know you get night sweats as a symptom sometimes, I don't get night sweats as such, more like periodic hot flushes. I don't know if this is relevant but I have been ill more times this year with coughs, colds, flu, tonsillitis etc than I have done in the past 5 years. I am normally fit and well with the exception of the odd bout of my bowel being lazy but nothing serious.

I don't know where I can turn to support and advice because nobody really understands, they just keep telling me to not think about it, but I can't help it. I am trying not to obsess over it but I will not lie, I am extremely frightened.

My doctor called me the next day after the blood tests and told me to come down to the surgery asap. Within hours, I was having an ultra sound of the abdomine and then the next day I had a CT Scan.  The ultra sound confirmed an enlarged liver & spleen, the CT confirmed the ultra sound plus multipe lymph nodes (mesentary nodes) enlarged.

Other blood tests confirm I do not have any form of hepetitis, or glandular fever, nor HIV. No auto immune.  These are my LFT results; which are higher than the results I had two weeks;

so my question is, does a CBC test check everything as far as all blood cell counts (red and white)?? or do certain other tests need to be taken for that. because i've read that people go in to the doctor to have one thing checked out, get a CBC done and find out by chance they could have leukemia or something else serious. and i know someone this happened too, was feeling tired and just went for a checkup got a CBC done and found out he has leukemia. not that i think i have it, its just that i am a hypochondiac so i just want to make sure nothing is wrong since a CBC was done on me and nothing seemed to pop up and suspicous.

NHL on this forum and would be reading more ... (NOTE: he had 2 tests because once it was not preserved properly that is what the Dr says)
here is the detailed report:

                I'm really freaking out and the obvious solution would be to go to a doctor but insurance is a problem and I don't have that option. That was  $250 for him to tell me he didn't feel anything.

Back in late may early june I thought I felt something went to doctor and he said he didn't feel anything. What I thought I felt hasn't grown and is movable. Movable as in I can grab it and move it somewhat between my fingers. It almost feels bean shaped. I used to suffer from really bad allergies where at least once a week I would have sneezing attacks for 24 hrs. Could this be a result from 3 yrs of bad weekly allergy attacks? Also since finding it not one lymphoma symptom has occured. I really hope I can get as much info as I can from any1 out there.

                Hi all,

I am here to find some reassurance before my FNA biopsy.

I am a 29 year old caucasian male with. I am generally healthy and active and have had no symptoms of any kind in the last 2 years. I do suffer from kidney stones but I don't think my enquiry is related to it (although I have had minor urinary tract infections - possibly due to stones moving abouts).

About 5 days ago I noticed a small bean shaped lump on the side of my neck (not between the jagular and sternocelidomastoid muslce), but rather on the sternocleidomastoid muscle itself (I think). I consider myself a bit of a hypochondriac so naturally internet search will reveal the worst. All it takes is 1 negative to throw me off balance completely.


I went to my GP and he said I might have lymphedema and sent me off to do a ultrasound of the neck followed by FNA. When I went to radiology in my local area, they misinterpreted it and ment that I do an FNA under the ultrasound. I changed that on the spot and did my ultrasound yesterday. This is what the radiologists report said:

""18mm x 6mm hypoechoic bulky node with no clear benign fatty hilum"". Report also states that all other lymph nodes are fine (left and right side of neck) and no other abnormalities are detected. They also suggested that I book an FNA and do the biopsy.

A million things went through my mind - one of them was even profit related for the radiology department as both of the procedures are separate and both cost money - one is $200 the other is $600 - so it is more profitable for them to suggest a FNA. Anyway no disrespect to anybody but you can imagine my mind is racing million miles an hour.

Naturally I went on the internet and checked some of the terms and did not get the best responses. There was a lot of contradictory information and misinformation - some made sence some didnt, some were in favour others weren't.

Now, based on my search hypoechoic mass or node and such don't reflect the u/s waves as good as hyperechoic (At least mine wasn't hypodense) - anyhow... some reports also say that loss of fatty hilum is not a good thing. Again, this is somewhat play on words in my report as ""no clear benign ..... "" - what does he mean when he says ""no clear"" - does this mean it is not clear, or it can not be seen at all, or fully absent?

Can nodes be hypoechoic - i read somewhere that they are usually hypoechoic. Can somethimes be absence or no clear indication of benigh fatty hilum?

Can this report conclude anything concrete or are they saying ""let's do a biopsy just to make sure it's all good"".

I am absolutely petrified and I can not function properly because this is all I am thinking about and there is 4 more days to the FNA procedure.

What are the chances of this being malignant or mastatic? What are the chances of this being nothing?

I've also read ont he internet about CSD (Cat Scratch Disease) - my fiance has a small kitten that I play around with and it bites and scratches me and I read that the symptoms of this are swollen lymph nodes in the neck and armpits.

I have no other symptoms of any kind. Like I tell myself even if god forbid is something bad - have I at least caught it on time to cure it?

Thank you so much in advance.

                I recently had a neck ct for several small nodes in my neck. My submandibular nodes have been somewhat large for about 20 months. They arent huge and you cant see them, but you can feel these ovals in the area. I went and had a CT scan of my neck and the report states ""Scattered small lymph nodes are seen throughout levels II, III, and IV of the neck"" and that : No discrete mass seen on this CT of the neck"". What does small lymph nodes of the neck mean? I have heard that if a radiologist is concerned about a node they will say ""pathologically enlarged"" node. Does small imply less than 1 cm? I remember having a CT of my abdomen about 1 year ago and they found ""small reactive lymph nodes in the lower right quadrant"". Are ""small nodes"" common on CT scans?

                For about a month now I have had a discomfort in my right arm pit whenever I move my arm in a certain direction, two days ago I finally decided to go poking around under there to see if there were any nodes swollen. Well, I didnt find any swelling, but I did make the pain worse, I am going to the doctor in a couple days. I have a physically straining job, but I have never been injured in my armpit.

                Hi,
About a month ago I went to bed with a fever and chills.The next day I felt slightly better but was very fatigued. I didnt have any cold or flu symptoms just the fever and aching joints and pain at the back on my eyes when I moved them along with swollen neck glands. I went to the doctor who just told me it is most likely viral and if I didnt feel any better in a couple of weeks to come back. I feel better than I was but I still have this lump on my neck. From looking on the net it looks to be posterior cervical lymph node. Its only about 2cm. It doesnt hurt at all. Its been a month since its been there. Would it be worth going back to the doctor to check it out or does it just take a while for it to go down? I keep reading about lymphoma so I am a little anxious.

                Hello,

This is my first time posting here as I have become desperate for some help/advice. My name is Andrea, I am a 26 year old female. Starting in Oct of last year (2010), I randomly noticed two large lumps on the back of my head/neck. Both sides were swollen quite a bit and kind of banded all the way across the base of my skull. This was the first time that I had noticed it and even though it caused discomfort I figured I would sleep on it and it would go away. Well It didn't...

Here it is almost a year later and I am still dealing with these swollen lymph nodes. I have been to two different doctors and have tried three different types of antibiotics, had multiple blood tests and was prescribed maxalt for migraines. The antibiotics obviously didn't work, and the maxalt helps with some of the symptoms...sometimes, but doesn't treat the problem. My blood tests have all come back normal with the exception of one in which it showed I had a very slight positive reading for the presence of anti nuclear antibodies. This blood test prompted my doctor to test me for lupus and the results were negative. Neither of the two doctors were able to diagnose me and I have struggled with seeking more help. One of the biggest issues is that I do not have health insurance so I can't see a specialist which is very frustrating. 

Here is a little of my health background:
I have hypothyroidism and have been being treated for that for the last 3-4years with levothyroxine. I also was diagnosed with PCOS (poly cystic ovarian syndrome) and am currently taking metformin for that. My grandmother passed away in her late 50's early 60's of lymphoma but I don't know much more than that.

A list of my sypmtoms:

Lymph nodes will swell and shrink periodically and don't always bother me.
I feel sluggish and fatigued ALL the time when they are swollen
I feel pressure in my head and almost like my ears are plugged while glands are swollen
I get random bouts of nausea but have never actually vomited 
I have chronic neck and back pain
I have had low grade fevers off and on
I feel like I have become weaker, its hard to lift things that usually are not an issue for me
I get dizzy/confused feeling sometimes
I get pounding in my head when I stand up or stretch
I have had gastrointestinal issues over the last year or two
within the last week I have noticed red bump along my hairline behind my right ear and my scalp seems to be itchy of and on.

My questions are does this sound like it could possibly be lymphoma? Because I don't have health insurance, what are my options? I truly feel like there is something going on with me but I don't know what to do, I cant afford to see a specialist out of pocket or get expensive scans. I have a three year old daughter and it scares me that this has been going on for almost a year and the doctors have not been able to diagnose me. I don't want to think that I could have cancer (Im sure nobody does) but I can't help but wonder if I could. What would you do? Any and all advice is welcome. 

Sincerely,
Andrea R.

                2 years ago I had a very WBC  (in the low 20s.)  It was found on a blood test before hand surgery.  My PCP had my surgeon check for a bone infection & there was none.  She wanted me to see a hem/onc, & I made an appointment, 6 weeks away.  Had my blood checked weekly & it went back to normal.

2 years later (& several hand surgeries later) I wasn't feeling myself.  I had been weaning off high doses of narcotics from surgeries & sort of was ""not myself"".  I wound up in the ER in May w/severe vomiting & dehydration.  At the time, my WBC was high, but they neglected to tell me.

I continued tapering off my medicines until I am now at 15 mg. morphine every 4 hours (though I don't take it that often.)  3 weeks ago, I again had an episode of severe vomiting for 16 hours & wound up going to the ER by ambulance.  I was admitted & seen by the hospitalist, infectious disease doctor, pain clinic doctor & a hem/onc.  I was very ill.  Temp of nearly 104.  My WBC were again in the 20s, then started coming down.  On discharge (after 6 days) they were around 16.  My RBC was slightly elevated, which prompted the hem/onc doc to come in.  (I actually knew him as he sees my dad for myleodysplastic syndrome.)  His feeling was the RBC was slightly elevated due to smoking and to have my primary care watch it for a month.  He also said the fact my dad had MDS didn't put me at risk for anything.

I saw my PCP in follow-up on Thursday.  She wants me to see a hem/onc regardless of whether my WBC goes back to normal or not.  She feels that having it this high twice in two years bears looking into.  She did mention CLL.  I am awaiting a call back on when my appointment will be.

During this time, I also had very bad night sweats, which would soak my clothes.  I did feel feverish but never really took my temp until I was in the hospital.  I'm just wondering if this sounds anything like CLL.  I fell unmotivated and tired but have trouble sleeping.  Also wondering if bone marrow biopsies hurt??

                back in mid june, maybe even late may, not sure... i felt lumps in my neck, kind of under the jaw, but were moveable and ive read and been told movebale lumps are nothing to worry about. i could pretty much roll them between my fingers. then i felt something that kind of felt like a lump that felt different then the moveable lumps. so i was worried at first and then put it out of my mind. now obviously its september so a few months have gone by and this ""lump"" hasnt grown or anything like that. and no other lymphoma symtoms have occured. so is this a sign that is couldnt be anything?? i've read that cancerous lymph nodes keep growing. im not sure how long this has been there but since finding it, it hasnt grown. good or bad sign?? and is it a good or bad sign that not one symptom has occured?

My son is 5 and has been sick with flu-like symptoms so I took him to his ped. and he tested for strep, mono and tried to complete a CBC test. The strep came back negative but the mono came back positive. He said he was concerned that the mono was such a strong positive for his age. The CBC was inconclusive because it was done by finger ***** and he said the blood clogged to quickly for accurate results. (my son has high-functioning autism so he freaks out with needles and blood, so that's why our ped decided to do a ***** first) He wants us back Monday for an intravenous (spelling?) blood test to get a better CBC. 

My concern is after researching the web (I know, I know) that a positive mono is rare in a young child and that cancer my be the real case, lymphoma. Are my concerns valued?

No other B symptoms. I had R-CHOP 3 years ago and went into remission. The oncologist is going to have a needle biopsy of one of the abdominal nodes in a few days but they are usually inconclusive. I am probably not eligible for stem cell therapy as my lungs are bad from sarcoid and the first chemo and I have hepatitis C.

I am a 41 year old female who has had bilateral swelling (started on left side in Feb 2011) which is now on both sides and very prominent.  I've seen my PCP who is stumped and did a CT scan which showed scattered lymph nodes but said could not verify any adenopathy by CT standards.  

Is there anything that may cause this on both sides?  I have not injured or strained my neck recently and it does not hurt to move my neck nor do the areas present any pain when touched/palpated.  What else could cause this?  

My doctor mentioned scleroderma (as I have been diagnosed with UCTD ) but said that frequently causes skin tightening.  The skin does feel tight but it's swollen.  

Past symptoms include fatigue, muscle/joint pain and my typical symptoms associated with UCTD.  I also have a past history of lymphadenopathy and had 1 biopsy and just learned that Hodgkin's was never ruled out so I am being referred to hematology in a month or so.

I am new here and I have a few questions please.

I am feeling no pain, i have not been sick with any flu, cold or virus for at least 6 years.
I had mono when i was in 8th grade ( now 57). I have fatigue ( a lot ) and nauseated at times. I have not lost any weight and have no other symptoms . I have had a CT and ultrsound done and both came back neg just showing the lymph nodes which i have a many of on both sides on neck but only 1 enlarged one.My PCP wants a biopsy done. Oh, and my blood work is fine. With the tests fine and the increased fatigue, could this be lymphoma? I guess I am looking for more symptoms. Any thoughts on this ??? Thanks in advance.

                6/14 Now for over 2.5 weeks I have had swollen glands and it been getting worse. I had first thought was just getting sick and waited a week before going to the doctor.
During that Week Other Symptoms:
Shortness Breathe~ Loss Appetite ~ Swollen Glands ~ Sore Throat (at time) ~  Excess mucus ~ Major Fatigue
6/21 Once went to doctor: noted I had a Low Grad Fever [ Tested for Step - Negative ]
Was given a ZPack and noted: Fever ~ Acute Pharyngitis ~ Lymphadenopathy ~ Nasal Logiciel ~ Acute Sinusitis
Well finished the Zpack and getting worse.
Went to Doctors again (Getting Dizziness and Feeling Like Fainting / No Sore Throat / Back Pain / Chest Pain / Very Fatigue)
6/27 Once at doctors Again: Tested for Mono [Negative] Blood was taken / Given another round of antibiotic 2xday for 10 days.
(During that time more Shortness of Breathe , Notice Now Weight Loss, More Feeling of Faintness, A little itchy)
6/29 Just got call from doctor and blood test was said to be all normal ( And puzzled that I was still not feeling better, was told to come back in on Friday if I was still not feeling better.) Just having that conversation, very short cause me to catch breath and cough.
Just got another call again from doctor putting me on Steroid pack and inhaler. And to come in on Tuesday if not feeling better.

Does this sound like anything any of you have gone threw with Lymphoma / Leukemia ?

                I am trying to put things together and would appreciate some help. Can the symptoms of fatigue and bruising be a sign of lymphoma? My symptoms started a few years before the swollen glands appeared... or at least that I noticed them. Can a person be asymptomatic for a couple of years before a lymph node appears?

                . My back continued to hurt, so I looked for any adverse effects of taking Oxycodone on the packaging of the Lexapro and did not see anything, so thought it was ok to take. Ten pills later, my ankles swelled and turned black and blue, got very very sick, itching, felt like an allergic reaction, etc., so stopped those pills. Went to a Hematologist and they diagnosed me with Myelodysplastic Syndrome anemia with excessive blast 2 progressing at a high rate into AML. My blast are 11%. I start experimental chemotherapy combination next Wednesday with the hope of remission. After that,  a stem cell transplant. I can only think the previous drugs did this, but can’t prove anything. Can the Lexapro SSRI and Oxycodone or Serotonin Syndrome cause bone marrow toxicity/suppression that will produce abnormal cells with red, white, and platelets low, that may mimic MDS? Cells in all 3 are deformed. If it is Serotonin Syndrome, will the Chemotherapy affect me badly? How can they test or treat this toxicity? Can you point me in the right direction if it has anything to do with this so I can convince my doctors or refer me to someone that may be able to help me? Thank you, please contact me as some as possible.

                I'm 39 and female, healthy. My CBCs for the last 3 years have been within normal range. In February 2011, I hurt my and was prescribed Oxycodone to relieve pain. After taking 12 pills in the prescribed dosage, I developed itching all over my body, so I discontinued use. In April, I was prescribed Lexapro, an antidepressant called selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor 10 mg. I took 9 pills and on the 10th day, I noticed side effects ranging from dizziness, dry mouth, low energy, Flu-like symptoms, stomach pains, behavior changes, quivering, joint pain, vision problems, to ringing in the ears, etc.. I called my doctor and she advised me to stop the medication admittedly, which I did. One week went by, with symptoms starting to decrease, when I took one Oxycodone, due to back pain. I than went into my doctor’s office with severe chest pains and she took a CBC. My counts came back very abnormal. I just had a normal CBC in March. The blood counts for April were, WBC 3.8, RBC 3.02, Hgb 10.7, HCT 33.0, MCV 109.3, MCH 35.4, Plat 29, with the other counts within normal range. They ran a EKG and it was normal. Blood pressure was abnormally low, heart beats on the low side. She referred me to a Hematologist.

user_1752928,playaz,/posts/Leukemia-and-Lymphoma-/Multiple-lumps-nodes/show/1566939,Multiple lumps/nodes,"
                Hi

Last week i noticed a lump on the back of my neck. It is on right side and it is under the skin so you can only feel it. To me it looks like it is around 1cm big and is not very hard, but its not moving.

Then i started to read about these and lymphoma and after that i have checked my groin area. And this is where i was surprised. I am able to feel on my groins a lot of lumps/nodes on both sides(around 4-5 on left and 3-4 on right site), the biggest one there is around 2cm. These are much harder comparing to the one on neck and it is not moving aswell. This got me very worried and I am not sure if this is normal or not and if people should feel their nodes on this area. I am more of a skinny person and 25 years male.

Any suggestions ?

                Hi,
My mum had low abnormal WBC for many years, always her test results came back around 3.6 for WBC. Her platelets and RBC was ok. Her neutrophile% came back (35%-50%) and her lymphocytes came back around (30%-60%) . 9 months ago she was diagnosed with ovarian cancer and she had chemotherapy for 6 months. Now 3 months after she finished chemotherapy ( she is in remission) her WBC always come back around(2-2.8). Her neutrophiles around 26%, lymphocytes around 65%. platelets and RBC normal. But her last test result about a week ago came back with low platelets as well 122.
A month ago she had protein electrophoresis, the result on urine came back all normal , but the result of blood came back a small abnormality on serum paraprotein 1.1g/dL (increased gamma). The pathologist suggested a further test to be done to determine kappa/lambda ratio. At the same blood test was told she has vitamin D toxicity >150. with Normal level of blood calcium. 24hrs urine test shows calcium excretion.

What can be the reason for wbc abnormality? Is there a risk of leukaemia or MM? or other type of blood cancers?

                In May 2010, I began experiencing severe malaise and such fatigue that I could hardly get out of bed or stand up for more than a few moments. Though I had abnormal wbc (very low), low lymphocytes, abnormal CAT Scan and bone marrow biopsy, I had to change doctors after months of wasted time to get a diagnosis.  I was diagnosed with large, diffuse B-cell lymphoma, stage III, and I started chemo (R-CHOP) in February and finished treatment June 12th.  I am worried because I am still experiencing symptoms, lots of them.  I have a chronic cough, especially when I am eating or have eaten anything, very severely dry eyes and mouth, fatigue, an irritated red area on my left hand and fingers, and frequent infections (including warts which I have never had before) ---all symptoms that I experienced last May (prior to chemo)  and through my illness/treatment. I guess I was expecting these to resolve now that I have gotten a clear CAT scan and have finished treatment. (1)What should I expect at this time?
(2) Could I have an underlying condition that is causing this that I should look into? (3) Do you recommend any particular tests at this time? Is my immune system going to be depressed as a result of the illness/treatment?
I am being careful as to diet and care.  I am female, 65 years old, and live in the US. Thank you for considering my questions.

                I am concerned about my five year old son. Last night before bed he was complaining that his ""heart hurt"". I figured he had indigestion or something like that since otherwise he was playing normally. He woke up around midnight absolutely screaming in pain. He started out saying it was his heart hurting, then he said it was his back. We ended up taking him the the ER since he was in so much pain. Once he got settled in at the ER, he calmed down and didn't seem like he was in as much pain. If fact, when the doctor finally saw us, he said it wasn't hurting at all. They really didn't do much besides take his vital signs which were all normal besides a low grade fever. The doctor pretty much told us to watch him and bring him back if it turns into chest pain.

I didn't think much until right before we left, I noticed this weird reddish/purplish mark on his forearm. It almost looked like marker, except it wouldn't rub off and looking closely, you can tell it's underneath the skin. When I got home, I did a little research and am now slightly concerned that it may be petechiae. It does not fade at all when pressed on. Looking back, he has also had a ton of bruising on his legs mainly, but he's a VERY active little boy, so I always just assumed it was normal kid bruises. He has also complained of leg pain quite a bit over the last few months. 

Combining the pain he had with the low grade fever and now this mark on his arm, I'm concerned. I'm posting a picture of this mark on his arm, I'm sorry it's not very clear. I plan on taking him into his pediatrician tomorrow, but feeling anxious until then. Any opinions?

Thanks so much.

About eight months ago, I started feeling an upper right abdominal discomfort in addition to an abdominal fullness. I also have frequent diahrrea and occasional spasms almost all over my body. I have also been generally feeling ill with aches in my joints, some pain iwhich I suppose are in my bones and occasional headaches. Just 2 weeks ago, I started noticing some blood spots under the skin of my arms. I also notice that my injuries take a long time to heal. I have seen an ENT, done a CT Scan of my head,, abdomen and pelvis which all came out fine, except that the CT Scan of my head revealed concha bullosa which all the doctors dismissed as nothing. I also did two Liver Function Tests, an ESR and two Complete Blood Count tests. The tests are all okay but the LFT showed my direct bilirubin was slightly elevated; the first CBC showed my RDW was slightly elevated, the MCHC was slightly low and the Monocytes was very high at 16.9% (upper limit of normal range is 10%). In the second CBC test about a month after, all tests were normal but the lymphocytes were slightly low. I have also done bleeding tests as well as a Coagulation Profile which shows my blood doesn't clot easily despite that all the clotting ingridients are notmal. I also have had painless nodes under my jaw which have never increased in size in the last 3yrs. I once had a dark patch over my left eyelid for close to a year but it disappeared last year. I am very worried right now and do not know what to expect as most of my symptoms seem to indicate leukemia. Could this be lymphoma? Someone please help

I've had small red dots on my arms but they went away after a couple of days. My lymph nodes in my neck are swollen. The nodules don't hurt, are about the size of a large pea and  there are several of them clustered together, but a few more scattered throughout my neck. I also have had ultrasounds of my neck, which showed thyroid cysts. I also have more cysts in other spots in my body. Some nights I have woken up sweaty and it wasn't warm in my apartment. I also had a fever and wasn't feeling well for almost a week. That was a couple months ago. Sometimes I still feel warm and pretty fatigued and just tired. Oh, by the way, my glands have been swollen now for around a year. My doctor thought it was just an infection and put me on Amoxicillin, but it only helped a little bit and only for a little while. She told me the swollen glands could possibly be from my adult acne. In addition, I've also noticed a much lessened appetite and I lost almost 10 pounds in almost a month. Any help is greatly appreciated!

                I had a major back surgery procedure and have been having chest pain and shortness of breath since the surgery. Here is the Pet Scan That I just had done yesterday;Please Help me understand my Pet Scan Report:
Findings:
PET:
There is homogenous, mildly increased FDG activity associated with an ill-defined anterior mediastinal soft tissue density. This finding in nonspecific and may be related to thymic tissue or rebound thymic hyperplasia. No discrete focal areas of intensely increased uptake within the thymus is identified. Minimal increased uptake is noted within the hilar areas bilaterally, right greater than left, in association with mildly prominent bilateral hilar lymph nodes. This finding is also nonspecific and may be reactive or malignant in etiology. Mild enlargement of the spleen is noted, with increased FDG activity compared with the liver. This finding is also nonspecific given the presenceof diffuse hepatic stestosis. Linear increased activity is noted in association with an anterior abdominal wall surgical scar. The remainder the body demonstrates physiologic uptake of radiopharmaceutical.
CT Scan:
There are postsurgical changes related to prior L5 left hemilaminectomy, S1 right hemilaminectomy, and L5-S1 fusion with an L5 right pedical screw, S1 left pedicle screw and interbody spacers at the L4-L5 and L5-S1 levels. A 5mm right lower lobe pulmonary nodule seen on series 3, image 66 is below the resolution of PET. There is diffuse hepatic steatosis, with an area of focal fatty sparing along the medial aspect of the gallbladder fossa. In addition, there is diffuse fatty atrophy of the pancreas.
IMPRESSION:
1. Mildly increased homogenous activity associated with an anterior mediastinal soft tissue density likely representing the thymus. This finding is nonspecific and may be related to persistent thymic tissue or thymic hyperplasia. Low-grade malignant involvement cannot be completely excluded. If clinically indicated, further evaluation with chest MRI to attempt to characterize the anterior mediastical soft tissue as thymic tissue can be performed. Alternatively, histologic sampling could be performed if there is a high clinical suspicion of malignancy.
2. Minimal increased FDG activity associated with mildly prominent bilateral hilar lymph nodes, right greater than left. These findings are also nonspecific and may be reactive or malignant etiology.
3. Increased FDG activity associated with an enlarged spleen is also nonspecific in the setting of diffuse hepatic steatosis.
4. 5mm right middle lobe pulmonary nodule unchanged compared with 06/23/2011 chest CT. If the patient has no risk factors for malignancy, a one year follow-up chest CT is recommended. If the patient has risk factors for malignancy, a chest CT in 6 to 12 months is recommended, with additional follow-up chest CT examinations thereafter to document 2 years of stability in the size and appearance of this nodule. At time of future imaging studies, the hilar lymph nodes and anterior mediastinal soft tissue can be re-evaluated.

                I had a kidney ct scan last year that showed I had several granulomas in my spleen. At the time my Dr. didn't seem concerned so I left it go. Well a year later I am feeling tired all of the time, my white blood count has been borderline low twice and 1 or two points below the low cutoff twice. I also have unexplained bruising, leg pains and digestive issues. My sister has CLL and I am a perfect match for her to recieve a bone marrow transplant from me. My concern is I do not feel well and with the low white blood counts I am concerned about being her donor. My health has been good with no frequent infections or fevers of any kind but it's just I am tired all of the time and my legs hurt. I saw an Oncoligist and she is doing another cbc to see where my counts are. She also wants me to have another Ct scan to see what the granulomas look like which I am a bit reluctant to do because of the radiation you recieve from those tests but not sure which way to go at this time. She also said if I want a bone marrow test she would do it to ease my mind about any cancer issues. I don't really want to go through that pain if I really don't need too. I am thinking about asking for an ultrasound of the abdomen instead of the ct but not sure this will be good enough to show what they are looking for. Any advice? Have any of you had spleenic granulomas and low white blood counts? If so, how did you proceed?

                well im back again. i went to the doctor for my armpit lumps and he didnt seem to concerned and said it seemed like a skin infection not lymph nodes. so he gave me amoxicilin (sp?) and said to come back if it didnt go away. thankfully they had both gone down to almost nothing. and im pretty sure that they are still almost nothing but curiosity has gotten the best of me and i have started checking constantly to make sure they are still small which they are. but im not sure if its starting to grow again. 

my question is if it was a cancerous lymph node would regular medicine have been strong enough to shrink it and then made it possibly grow again?? the medicine was only for 7 days. and just to be clear, im not sure if the lumps have actually started growing again, maybe just me being paranoid. and WHAT ARE A NORMAL SIZE FOR LYMPH NODES CONSIDERED NORMAL??

                I am 17 year old girl, and I have 3 or more swollen lymph nodes in my neck. They do not hurt, some are small, some are getting close to 2 cm. If I lean my head back, I can see one of them above my adams apple protruding from my skin.They are a little hard but I'm not sure how they are supposed to feel originally. I am wondering what else could cause this because I don't have many other symptoms. Some random nausea (usually in the morning) a persistent fever, and sometimes a bit of stomach pain. 

No doctor will take me seriously, I have von Willibrands disease and they treat me like I'm just like everyone else, which is nice but I wish they would understand that it can cause further complications.

My main question, is it cancer? I do not think it is, but I am scared anyways. Please help I don't know what else to do.

                Im 18 years old and about 6-8 months ago i found a marble sized lump just under my jaw around the epiglottis area. Then about a month and a half ago I began to find another lump on my left supra clavicle area. This one is much larger! I went for an ultrasound and chest xrays and they both came up normal. The lumps aren't painful and are slightly movable. I am very active and they don't bother me then either. I am concerned though because the one on my collarbone seems to be spreading towards my shoulder more and more everyday. A new pea sized lump appeared more towards my shoulder about 2 weeks ago. The only other persistent symptom is that I was getting these really bad pulsing headaches very frequently for quite sometime. Now instead of multiple times a day they come every day or two. 
  I went back to my doctor and he ordered bloodwork and sent me to a Otolaryngologist. But my appointment isn't for 2 1/2 months....I received a call not too long ago saying that im at the top of the waiting list, which means that if someone cancels i get dibs on that appointment first before others. Should i be concerned? what COULD the lumps be?

                Okay about 3yrs ago I noticed a small hard bump behind ear, did the going to the PCP who sent me to the ENT, who said there is not anything to worry about. I did not worry about it because I had PLENTY of MRI, head & neck ct scans for other issues & ironic part was I had to have my submandibular gland along with two enlarged lymph nodes removed , and I am assuming it did not show up on any of those tests, or I would have been told. That is how small it was apparently. Did not worry about again. About 3 months ago I noticed it had gotten bigger. It is hard, so I went back to my PCP who at first thought it was an abscess & he could cut & drain it there & then, I held off because I was already scheduled to see a surgeon (follow up for fistula's), so my PCP told me to ask the surgeon his opinion on the bump. Long story short, had ultra sound, ct-scan & yes it is a 2cm hard fixed lymph node that has grown slowly. The surgeon said, that a FNA would not really help him much so he recommended I get it surgically removed. I really NOT worried about it being cancerous because I know I have had the blood tests to test for cancer when I lost 30lbs in like 3-4 months & developed night sweats (3yrs ago). I am female so I do assume it is from hormonal changes after all I am 41; I still get night sweats & still under weight, BUT I don't feel like there is anything else wrong, I am not fatigued, HOWEVER, I do take B12.

Okay my question is should I get it removed? He already told me the 2cm is NOT normal & that a FNA would not be a definite diagnosis if there is anything to it. the reason I am hesitant is because he would have to shave some of my hair..Yes I know shallow....sorry, that is my only worry....cancer does NOT run my family.

                Please i really need some help/opinions, i cant stop crying right now :(

Im 23 and last september (9months ago) i noticed a couple of swollen nodes in my groin, a month later a couple appeared on the other side of my groin, then 1 came up on the left side of my neck at the same time. i now have about 6 in groin areas and one in neck but think another little one is coming up next to the one in my neck.

i went to hospital last september and they done an ultrasound on my groin and neck and they said they didnt think they were cancer, and the one in my neck was a 'reactive node' meaning due to infection, not cancer. 

they said to come back 3months later to see if they had got bigger. i went bk and they hadnt grown atall. i went bk in february and again they havent grown, and when they feel all the nodes they dont think they feel cancerous, even though they dont hurt and are a little bit hard not soft, they feel rubbery a little bit but cant mnove them that much. the one in my neck and i can move around but the new little one i can feel doesnt move atall.

they said to me they would have grown in size if it was cancer, but ive read on the internet that it can take years and grow slowly, and multiplication of nodes (not growth) can also be a sign of lymphoma nodes.. i have had blood tests and they always come back fine, ive had chest xrays and they too are fine. 

i dont know what to do, i have another check-up tuesday and im so scared. i really do think something bad is going on, why would i just have all these nodes up for 9 months with no sign of infection anywhere?!!!!! do u all think this is lymphoma?? i dont have any other symptoms, no weight loss, no night sweats (sometimes a bit hot in the night). but i get dizzy spells all the time which i know could just be anxiety cos i used to suffer from really bad anxiety and panic attacks a few months back.

i am so scared, im only 23 :( why arent these nodes going away?? why are more appearing?? a doctortold me that 9months down the line i would have other symptoms of lyphoma, and know for sure something is wrong, but i dont agree. ive heard it can take years and years for nodes to grow and the fact is im getting MORE of them, and i dont have ANY sign of infection ANYWHERE.. i am literally sat here in tears and i dont know what to do.. i really do think this is lymphoma as nodes dont just come up, stay there, and multiply for no reason!! if its not lymphoma then i wanna know what infection i have!! ive had a couple of antibiotics last month for bladder infection so if i had any infection anywhere then those antibiotics would have cleared it up right?? i just want the nodes to go down and go away, i need answers, i cant understand why they are multiplying and the doctors dont seem bothered?!! just cos they arent growing and im not losing weight/sweating at night time!! they refused to biopsy in february cos they said it would be too invasive as they dont think its lymphoma. THEY DONT THINK. doesnt sound very positive if you ask me.,. 

im so sorry to everyone to moan like this, i just need to know what you all think, i cant stop crying :(

thanks so much for any replies xxxx

For the past month I've been have a great deal of anxiety due to medical symptoms I've been having. First started with a random nose bleed which was small yet frightenging(sp) for someone with anxiety. Went to the doctors and asked for a CBC along with iron count and he added an IGE check. Blood levels came back normal, as did iron but the ige levels were above normal (which i heard suggest allergies) and haven't had a nosebleed since. Since getting the tests I've noticed small bruises on my legs (2 of them, which i dont remember hitting that area) and on on my forearm that healed, and then came back 2 weeks later and healed again. I have what i thought were swollen lymph nodes (1 on neck thats been swelling up and then going back to normal for the past year) but doctors that I've shown have told me there not swollen enough for concern. Also noticed small red dots which are called petechaie on my arms and 1 or 2 on legs, 1 on chest. About 15 in total on my body and all are 1mm or smaller and widely spread rather than clustered like a rash. Noticed a couple drops of blood in stool today so went to a walk in clinic and was told that unless the whole stool was bloody then there should be no worry over a couple drops. With all these symptoms happening its caused alot of stress and worry, I've been to the doctors office about 12 times in the past month explaining these things to doctors and no one seems to think its serious and don't offer additional testing, yet everywhere I look online suggests that I could have a serious underlying disorder. One more thing I've noticed is a higher heart rate than normal while doing something that isn't ""resting"" such as climbing stairs or lifting heavier objects, and this has been happening for the past 4 or 5 days and usually happens when I get a cold or chest infections but i dont have either as of yet. Should i be insisting to the doctors for more testing? I find it hard to believe its all in my head and the doctors are right when all this seems to be happening at once.

Also the doctor put me on Singulair for allergies, cipralex for anxiety and depression and Xanax to help with the anxiety, so some of these symptoms might be from the meds although I've noticed most if not all of them before starting to take them.

This is the third time in the past year I've had anxiety due to medical reasons, but I cant help but worry about things such as luikemia or lymphoma as my symptoms match alot of their symptoms.

                Hi there! I had posted here before and found the advice given very helpful so I was hoping to get some more! I have FINALLY had my ultrasound done and now am more worried than before :( Briefly, my problem started with one swollen lymph node on the right side of my neck and constant headache a year ago. I am suffering severe fatigue for the past few months(really struggling to wake up). The gist of the ultrasound was lots of pretty big lymphs on average 19mm x 6mm(about 10 this size) and lots of other of similar size. There were a lot more under the collarbone as well. Saw the consultant today for the result and he was horrid. He basically said if its cancer we will treat you if its not go away and deal with it and get on with your life(I wish I was joking!!). ""Come back in 2 weeks for a biopsy"". That was it. I explained that over the past year I have had multiple courses of antibiotics(at least 15 I've lost count) and therefore if it was infection would so much antibiotics not have gotten rid of whatever it may be? He said ""the patient he had seen before me had a large sist on the back of his neck from acne and the antibiotics cleared it up nicely""?????? So this gives you an idea of what I'm dealing with(no option to go somewhere else I'm afraid). When my husband asked him was it relevant that there were so many large ones he simply replied ""They are not considered large"" So my questions to you good folks are: Would you be worried about so many large lymphs? is 19mm x 6mm considered large? Is it normal to keep getting more and more despite all of the antibiotics?  And finally, does the biopsy hurt AND work??? Many thanks in advance

                Hi ,

I have a doubt in the categorization of lymphoma. 

I assume Lymphoma has been primarily classified into two types. Hodgkin s and Non Hodgkin s.

Under which type does Nodular Lymphocyte predominant Hodgkin s Lymphoma falls? 

And which one of HL or NHL is associated with HIV. 

I have been diagnosed with NLPHL recently and doctor has asked to take HIV test so I am a bit tense. 

Please help.


Thanks

I have been having night sweats for over 3 months (almost every night). Have swollen lymph node behind right ear that ct scan showed as a 6mm cyst. My ENT decided to just watch it for 6 months. Asked ENT about night sweats and he said they were probably lymphatic and not his area :/ Now my PHP has made me an appointment with an internal medicine doctor about the night sweats. Also have 2 cysts in my thyroid, but ENT was unconcerned with those as well because my thyroid levels were checked many times and normal range. Have felt generally yucky (no energy, etc.). Have also had really bad constipation since January that has changed to diarrhea in past couple of weeks. I have crohn's disease so the diarrhea is normal but the constipation is not. I have not had any weight loss, but I always eat weather I am hungry or not because of the crohn's disease since I was 10. I am now 29. I am a full time college student and mom, so this is really putting a strain on my life and the internal medicine doc appointment is still well over a week away.

It is about an inch across and 1.5cm in length. It does not hurt at all, unable to move it, and can see it under my skin. I think it is a bit bigger than when i first noticed it. The other day I noticed that the lymph node on the other side of my neck is becoming swollen too, though not as big.

For months I have had extreme tiredness, no amount of sleep seems to cure it. No other symptoms, no sign of an infection etc. 

I have had blood work done, general CBC and HIV tests, all negative. Also, a chest x-ray was performed, which was clear. My doctor has referred me to have a biopsy. 

My questions are, is it possible to have lymphoma without feeling like anything is wrong with you? Also, surely my doctor would have tested me for other infections such as mono etc, if he thought it was an infection? Does the fact that he has sent me for a biopsy rather than more tests for infections something to be concerned about? 

I don't want to sound like a hypochondriac, but i'm curious and a little worried. A second opinion is always needed.

If anyone could help me, that'd be great. Thank you

                Hi,
I have been recently diagnosed with Lymphoma. immunohistochemistry report is yet to be received . CT scan suggestive of lymphoma and all the symptoms are present. I do not have swollen lymph node on neck.  I have enlarged spleen with hypo dense lesions and in stomach mucosa was present and presence of chronic gastritis. Lymph nodes under my arms are swollen and left one was really big. 

My doubt is whether I am having this lymphoma due to HIV infection.  I remember once While drunk and trying to have sex the condom came off  during insertion, but I realized it. But it was too late since I touched her private part with mine. Could it cause HIV infection because I do not know the girl?  Am really worried.  Any suggestions would be really helpful.

                Hello. 

I just thought i'd post on here to see if anyone could help me with some questions I have. 
I'll give you a quick overview, promise i'll keep it short. 

I am a 22 year old female, generally good health, weight, non-smoker etc. About 14 months ago I noticed a swollen lymph node under my left ear, near the end of my jaw. It was about 1cm across and 1.5cm in length. It does not hurt at all, unable to move it. I think it is a bit bigger than when i first noticed it. 

I have had blood work done, general CBC and HIV tests, all negative. Also, a chest x-ray was performed, which was clear. My doctor referred me to a consultant who dismissed me straight away and just said it was one of those things, and he wasn't concerned at all, this made me feel a little bit foolish at the time. 

Anyway, a year has passed and my lymph node has definitely increased in size. My parents and boyfriend can now see it underneath my skin by just looking at me, and I would probably say it's doubled, maybe nearly tripled in size. It is still painless and hard. Now this has obviously got me worried. I have also noticed that after a heavy night of drinking (which isn't very often!) the next day my lymph node can be quite tender, and sort of aches. It's not a shooting pain, but it's definitely more sensitive. Whereas usually it doesn't hurt at all. I am in perfect health otherwise, I rarely get ill. 

Would you recommend going back to the doctors and insisting on more tests? Or just ignore that it has increased in size. They made me feel a little bit foolish last time I went and it has put me off going back about the same problem. 

If this has happened to anyone else please could you tell me, and what the outcome was? 

Thanks :)

                Hi, I am a 21 male, and six month ago, I found 2 lymph nodes on my mandibular(both sides), at that time I thought it was HIV, I took 2 tests, all turn out to be negative, so I thought it was oral infection, so I went to dentist to do the oral hygiene, it didn't work, still bleeds a little when i brush my teeth, and still feel uncomfortable with my teeth(but not hurt). Like 2 weeks ago, I found 3 lymph nodes on my left cheek and one on my right, one on my groin, I dont know if they been there for a long time or just newly appear, they dont hurt, and I think they are not hard, I can move them, meanwhile I don't have fever or pain throat, but I suffer from tiredness, mainly back. So right now I think I have Lymphoma or Leukemia. I feel desperate right now.
PS, when i was young i have nose bleed, but i did several blood test, turn out to be normal
I didnt drink or smoke, and i am lazy
I dont know if it;s because of pressure or something
Seriously I'm really worried right now, and I lived aboard alone, so need you guys help.
Thanks all.

                I have been diagnosed with large diffuse b-cell lymphoma. At first, I was just having some tightness in my arms near my elbow, but now it has changed over the past few months.  I have some small subtle swollen areas, more prominent veins than usual, pain from the shoulder to elbow, and recently a vein in one of the fingers of my left hand was very painful, swollen, turned blue and looked as if it were going to burst. Finally, after a few days it returned to normal, but the pain and other symptoms are still there. My doctor does not know what this could be.  Any ideas?  I was assuming that it was related to lymphoma in some way since the symptoms began at the time that my lymphoma became acute.

                hi all. i wrote here a few weeks ago and unfortunatly got no response. but i have a few quick questions that will hopefully get answered.

first off do cancerous lymph nodes in the armpit shrink? or do they continue to enlarge. also what does it mean if the lump seems to fluctuate in size. i find that the lump even though PAINLESS, has shrunk alot since i first found it almost 2months ago, but me being paranoid i touch it alot and it get bigger again and then real small. but never bigger than 1cm (1/2 inch). what does this mean? this lump is also somewhat moveable. it can be moved back and forth.

also since finding the original lump in my right armpit which seems to continue to shrink, i constantly kept checking my left armpit. this past weekend i found another lump which only seemed to grow and get painful and actually come to the surface since finding it. it has shrunk alittle since finding it 5 days ago. and this lump is PAINFUL. i used to always get these in the past. idk if me touching it all the time has made it stick around longer than usual. so but same with the other lump it seems to be shrinking, not getting any bigger than it was when originally found. 

any info would help alot. thankss.

I have a doctors appointment tmrw morning for a normal check up. I have been going back and forth about bringing the lumps up to him only because they have gone down so much which I have read if a good sign. Means it cant be cancer. Im just worried that hes going to get me nervous by sending me somewhere else to have them checked out. I just want him to tell me yes or no if there is or isnt something to worry about so  I can for once and for all put this out of my head. I would appreciate a prayer or two for tmrw morning. And hopefully I can report back here with good news...

She passed away a few months later but I am a survivor. Now I am a single mother with my miracle son who was born a little after a year from me finishing my treatment for cancer. But now I am having so many anger problems and depression I have a serious concern for my son's health and mine. I've lost my temper a few times now and i don't feel like I'm in control of any of my emotions. I just know, I need help. My mother and family have been giving me ideas but nothing has worked.

                I had surgery last Monday to remove an enlarged lymph node in the mesenteric region.  I was told that this lymph node showed on a CAT scan from 2008 and was the same size, so cancer wasn't highly suspected.  I received a call today from my surgeon who informed me that the pathology report showed Hodgkin's Lymphoma.  I am shocked and worried, but trying to stay positive.  I see my oncologist Friday to discuss this more.  I had extensive testing, including CAT and PET scan a month ago, and it only showed activity in this particular lymph node.
What are the chances that this has spread, or I still have lymphoma, even though the entire lymph node was removed, and previous PET scan showed only isolated involvement?  My thinking is that if it was truly isolated, and they removed it, then I am ""cured"".  However, I know very little about this disease.
Any information would be so great!

                Hello there and thanks for taking the time to read my question, 


I am a female age 33 years old and up until this year my bloodwork has always been perfectly normal.  In November my Gynecologist told me that my Vitamin D levels were low and prescribed Vitamin D for me to take for 10 days.  I did that like I was supposed to and haven't been to the doctor until this month.  But to recap here is the problems I have been noticing.  In March, I noticed that my feet and hands were itching.  I wondered if I had athletes foot so I used Lotramin and that went away.  Then I noticed a few days that I had a welt that itched on my neck.  I was really stressed out at this time and just figured it was stress.  Later at the beginning of April, I went to the tanning bed and afterwards got a hive like rash on my back that lasted for about an hour and went away.  Afterwards, every day I have been having hives that will come up in different spots at a time and will last for about 20 mins and then go away.  About three weeks ago, I then got a sore throat and had a fever.  I went to the doctor and they did a strep test which came back negative and checked my blood.  My sodium level was low and my white blood count and granulocytes were very high and my lymphocytes were low. The Dr. put me on Omnicef for 10 days.  I went back to the doctor a few days ago, and everything else turned out normal except now I had high Calcium and High Total Blood Protein.  My Total Protein was 10.6.  I am worried about the possibility of Cancer or something serious.  Do you think it would be Leukemia if just a few weeks ago my Calcium and Blood Protein was normal and now it is not.  Could medications like Omnicef cause this increase?  Thank you in advance for any help you can give me.

                OK... the thyroid ultrasound results are a bit confusing to me and I haven't spoken to my doctor yet, and wont until Monday afternoon, but they did find more nodules than just the one that was found on the CT scan. T

There are 3 nodules all together. One on the right lower lobe 1.1 cm, isoehoic with anechoic rim, the Left Isthimus has a nodule, 3.6mm a vague hypoechoic area. The lower left lobe has a isoechoic structure 4.1mm, there appears to be a halo. No hypervasularity appearing, Impression - multinodular goiter.

The only thing now is to correlate all this with the nodes found in the neck on the CT, (no US was done on the neck) but CT showed jugular chain, bilaterally fron and back nodes and one occiptical node, and under the chin, submandular and submental regaion which I have read is not a good sign. 


The first time I had any tests done was an ultrasound on my breasts after 2 mammograms and they found 2.7 cm lymph auxillary tail nodes and said to come back next year that it was nothing to worry about. Now it seems I have them everywhere! The Pelvic US showed the same thing many, many cysts on endoemetrial complex, heterogenous in appearance and nabothonian cysts and a 13mm on ovaries with endometrial thickness and ct showed inguinal nodes under 12mm.

All of this started with swollen nodes, fatigue, and tachycardia, abnormal blood counts and urine analysis. For the past two months I have had elevated WBC, lower RBC, high platelets, and high Lymph#. Urine has consistently shown protein, blood and leukocytes. Most of y pain is in pelvic area and bones.

6 months ago I noticed if I run my hand along the bones in my lower leg I would feel pain in the bones now it is that way with my skin over the joints and especially the knees, I feel lumps under my skin in these places and have told this to every doctor I have seen. 

I was tested for Lupus, RA, all kinds of infectious diseases, STD's and Aids. All negative, ITher 
lyme disease test showed up positive for IGM P23, but that was not enough to consider it to consider it Lyme Disease, my dr. was going to start treatment for it anyway, since nothing else was positive (cat scratch fever, e. coli, bartonella all negative) but after CT's and US results wants me to see an oncologist. The only other positive results is EBV virus of 8.0 when it should be 1.0, very high, and C-Reactive protein high at 6.0. Would cancer cause those kind of results and what does the protein p23 have to do with cancer? This has been a roller coaster since April Fools Day, my first appointment!!

 I'm just one big nodule/cyst!!! By the way what is the difference between a tumor and a nodule, node, and cyst??

Any advice would be great!

Hoping for the best for all of us,

Krissy

By the way I am 39 years old and cancer seems to show up in everyone on my father's side of the family at this age:(

                Hello everyone. I have a few questions about a lump in my left armpit. I noticed it a week ago and at first it was very long actually. It was the length of my index and middle fingers next to each other in width if that makes sense. It was also very painful. Now it has shrunk in size and has gotten more round. Its less than an inch in size when at first it was larger than an inch. So my question is since I have read that cancerous lumps dont shrink they continue to grow and they also hurt, is there any chance that since this lump has shrunk and has started to slowly lose the pain feeling too, it could still be cancer? Or is the fact that it has shrunk automatically rule out cancer?? This lump also feel very squishy but still kind of hard but not rock hard. There is still some pain when i squeeze it. What does that mean? Thanks for answering and reading

                Hi everyone I'm Libby from London :)

Looking for some advice regarding symptoms I've been having! I'm a 19 year old female student.  I have a history of osteosarcoma diagnosed when i was 12 and treated successfully with cisplatin, doxorubicin and methotrexate.  I have endometriosis which is controlled and selective igA deficiency which isn;t expected to cause any problems.

For the last 10 days, I've had swollen glands all over my body from my neck and behind my ears, to my armpits, under my collarbone and now elbows.  I'm a bit more tired than usual and have lost my appetite in the last 3 days or so.  I also have had some pain in my chest which seems to be radiating from the pain in my armpits from the glands.  All the glands are quite sore.  I'm itching all over my body as well as around the glands.

I don't think I have mono because i have no fever and don't think i am ill enough.  I have been to the doctors who was hopeless, didn't even check my notes before seeing me and just gave me antibiotics.  I've completed the weeks course and am no better.

I don't really think it's likely to be anything cancerous because there are so many glands swollen...but my medical history makes me slightly worried.

Can anyone offer any advice? It would be very much appreciated.

                36 years old. Female.   In June 2009, I had a GI bleed for 8 days. My stool was completely black those days and on the seventh day I was hospitalized for anemia/weakness. An endoscopy and colonoscopy were performed and both were negative. No further GI studies were done, and I was discharged. While in the hospital, my blood values showed very low WBC and low neutrophils. I was referred to a hemotologist who has monitored me since then. All my blood counts since June 2009 have shown the same results, low wbc and low neutrophils (absolute). Otherwise, I have been healthy with no increase in infections.  

In January 2011, I began to wake at night with severe bouts of trembling every few days. In Feb, I began to experience pain in my mouth (palate, tongue, gums) along with right flank pain and nausea. By March, the trembling began to increase dramatically, accompanied by an episodic flushing sensation in my face and arms. Both my blood pressure and heart rate would rise as well when these episodes happened.

I was hospitalized for 8 days. I underwent many tests, but all came back normal (except my blood values for wbc and neutrophils). CT of the abdomen was normal as was an MRI of the brain. No sign of gallstones, and my gallbladder contracts normally. I am not diabetic.  

A 24 hour urine test did show an extremely elevated cortisol level, way above the normal range. I was put on a serotonin uptake medicine and that has alleviated the trembling. However, my mouth pain, right flank pain and nausea have persisted. I am still neutropenic.

I have a new internist who has ordered me an upper GI, small bowel follow-through exam next week. She suspects that my GI bleed in June 2009 may have something to do with all of this. She has also ordered me to see an endocronologist due to my cortisol levels being so elevated.

Prior to June 2009, I was never found to be neutropenic.  I do not have an extensive medical history. I am a healthy, happy, and busy wife/mother. I do not have time for these problems. I am thin, with no history of any mental/psych issues (in case someone is wondering).

Could all these issues be related to GI? I am stumped, as is my internist.

                Okay.... well on either side of my jaw...

They feel kinda hard and/or rubbery, dont hurt..... sometimes feel a little tender. I will point out im 18 and first found this about 5 years ago! they never seem to have gone down in this time! anyone give me any insight on what it could be?? thanks so much!! my worst fear is lymphoma :S

About six months ago, I started feeling an upper right abdominal discomfort in addition to an abdominal fullness. I also have frequent diahrrea and occasional spasms almost all over my body. I have also been generally feeling ill with aches in my joints, some pain in my bones and occasional headaches. Just 2 weeks ago, I started noticing some blood spots under my right hand. I have seen an ENT, done a CT Scan of my head, a LFT , an ESR and a CBC. The tests are all okay but the LFT showed my direct bilirubin was slightly elevated; the CBC showed my RDW was slightly elevated, the MCHC was slightly low and the Monocytes was very high at 16.9% (upper limit of normal range is 10%). I have been to an ENT and did a CT Scan of my head and the result was normal. I also have had painless nodes under my jaw which have never increased in size in the last 3yrs. I once had a dark patch over my left eyelid for close to a year but it disappeared last year.  I am very worried right now and do not know what to expect. Could this be leukemia? Someone please help

                I am concerned about a lump on my left arm about two inches from my elbow. It seems to be on a nerve because it is causing my arm to shake. the lump hurts. The arm only seems to shake from where the lump is down to the wrist. I think another smaller lump is starting about an inch from the other along the same nerve. Any educated opions would be extremely apreciated. I am currently seeking a doctor. I have an apointment first week of next month.

                I'm having a nerve issues and need the right set of eyes on this so I can be treated with the correct diagnosis.

The event that sent me to the doctor was waking up one morning in August of 2010 with numb toes and numb hands. Tops of both, as well as a small circular area on the back of my head.

Over a year ago, I began to have double vision. I thought it caused by the light reflection from the work I do as it would not be there in the morning but worsen throughout the day. I bought a pair of polarized lens which lessened the effect of this. Today, I haven’t had problems with double vision, but my vision now changes where it actually improves to the point I can’t stand wearing my glasses for near slightness.

The doctor performed a glucose tolerance test. It was normal.

I had MRIs done on both my brain and spinal column.

In December, doctors diagnosed me with MS and sent me to a specialist.

The specialist, after viewing the MRIs, lesions on the brain, no lesions on the spine, and EMG, and a spinal tap I had done, which showed negative for MS. She felt I did not have MS.

I've also have these strange feelings in my head where it feels like I'm going to pass out, or feel a swimming in my head. Neither of these describes this accurately, the closes I can get, it’s like getting up off the floor and having that head rush.

Long ago, I would get these feeling while looking up for an extended period of time, but to a much lesser degree.

I used to do this exercise where I would place my hands on the back of my legs and put my head on the floor while standing on tip-toes and roll my head back and forth. It caused discomfort in my head and I stopped. That’s been three to four years ago.

Since then, I’ve had pain in my chest, and would feel pain shoot down my left arm. Because you hear this type of pain could be a heart attack, I told the doctor I’ve had hundreds of heart attacks each day.

He said that wasn’t possible. (of course, he was right)

I came to realize, the location of my left arm had something to do with the pain if I held my arm to closely next to my side, (which I do off and on performing my work.)

I also have hundreds of lipolmas, (discovered these in my early twenties.)

I figured out one of these lipolmas on the side of my chest, about 3 inches down from my armpit, would cause the pain when I pressed against it.

The doctor scheduled a stress test for my heart and wanted me to see a surgeon for the lipolmas.

I had several lipolmas removed on 1-12-11. The pain in my chest went away as a result. Later, I told the doctor if I put pressure where the lipolma was located, I could still bring the pain back. He thought time would heal.

It’s been over two months; it hasn’t gotten better. 

When I went in for the stress test, they kept placing a blood pressure cuff on my left arm while on the treadmill. One time, the lady got the cuff on as high as it would go. When it pumped up, it caused a sharp pain in my arm.

After sleeping with my arm above my head, the numbness in my hands and on my head goes away. The numbness in my feet seems less.

It’s gotten to the point where I have to keep my arm away from my chest. If I don’t, the feeling in my head gets worse. The back of my calves and my left eye will twitch. It makes the numbness in my hands return.

As of today, there is no weakness or loss of motor skills.

                I am a 17 year old male.  

I've had a lymph node in my groin enlarged (about 2 cm in size) since about October of last year, it is now May, so about seven months.  I did go to an oncologist for it in January, but after examining it he said it was nothing to worry about (mobile, no night sweats, no weight loss, nothing else) and I was relieved.  

It hasn't really grown, but surely hasn't decreased in size either, and still no other symptoms have arisen.  However, just yesterday I felt ANOTHER node, just below it, that I'm pretty sure wasn't there before, and it is almost as big as the original one.  Still painless, however.  

Should I go back to my doctor, even though I've already pestered him about it so much until he finally decided to send me to an oncologist who said it was fine?  

Also, I am a runner who trains pretty vigorously as part of the track team.  Could heavy exertion, especially with my legs, have caused this?

                I have a 4 1/2 year old son. 6 weeks ago his doctor discovered he had swollen lymph nodes scattered through the front and back of his neck. He also had a low White Blood cell count (4.1). Slightly elevated AST (58). He also had some other tests which she said showed ""elevated liver enzymes"". Since then we have discovered he also has swollen axillary nodes (both sides), superclavical node (right side), scattered nodes in the groin (both sides). He is very pale. He complains of bain pain in different parts of his legs and sometimes hip on a daily basis. He also sleeps alot for his age (8pm-11am +naps). He does play and run, but tires easily and wants to take a rest frequently. He tends to have very itchy skin, and has gotten red itchy patches on his stomach and chest that last for several weeks at a time. His doctor just took some more blood work yesterday, we are still waiting on some results, but the AST is back and still elevated (43). Lymph nodes seem to be getting slightly bigger, and more of them swollen. Can anyone offer some ideas on what might be going on with him? We are very concerned for our little guy, and his doctor doesn't seem to be moving very quickly on it. She just says we will wait and see, check again in a month. So we waited, now she is telling us to wait again. Any advice on what the problem could be would be greatly appreciated, thanks for your time!

                Hi. I have already posted in this forum once already for the same question I am about to ask. But since my last post a new problem has occured. 

To start off with, a little background. About a little over a month ago I got a BAD severe itchy rash on my left hand. Within minutes I noticed this rash move over to my right hand. Then up my arm. I went into the bathroom and took off my shirt and noticed the rash now kind of crawling up the side of my arm. I felt itchiness also on my legs so i took off my pants and rash was also down on my legs too. Noticed it on my shoulders. It was almost everywhere except my face. I jumped into the shower to try to wash anything off if it was an allergic reaction to something. I made the mistake of looking up what this could be and typed in ""lumps"" instead of ""bumps"" and all this cancer stuff came up. So I was a little familiar with basic lymphoma info. So I checked my armpits since the rash was in that area also and noticed this hard lump under my right armpit. Didnt think to much of it at first since I used to always get painful lumps in that area in the past from the old deodorant i used to use and from sweating from alot of activity. But this lump was PAINLESS. The day of me noticing it, it was MARBLE SIZE! Now, almost a month and a half later, its still there but alot smaller. My question is, if this was cancer would it have shrunk the way I described? The lump is also movable if that means anything. I have read that most enlarged lymph nodes take weeks or months to return to normal size and some just remain alittle enlarged forever. I still think this lump is due to that weird rash which i forgot to mention went away the next morning. Any help would help me alot. Thanks.

I am a little confused about my lab results following my annual physical. My white blood count shows 3.8 reference (3.8-10.8) which shows to be normal. Of course by mistake I googled low WBC and came up with some scary possibilities. I know it shows normal but it’s on the bottom of the normal range and I was wondering if I need to follow up in a couple of months or wait until my next physical next year.  Appreciate any feedbacks.

                Can someone have cancer for a year with little or no outward symptoms?
I'm 18 and I noticed a swollen lymph node a year or so ago. I didn't think too much of it and then I found another one, smaller than the first. 

They are both on oppisite sides of the back of my neck. The doctor said they were small and rubbery. They haven't really gotten bigger and they don't hurt. The doctor said it was from infection, but I wouldn't have had an infection for a year and felt fine the whole time...

Should I be worried? 

Also, I'm sure I don't have cancer, but should I be more aggressive in finding out why my lymph nodes are swollen. I've been to one doctor who said infection, but that doctor was rushing and I felt like I couldn't talk to him. 

Thank you.

I was given (IV) Ativan once in an ER and within minutes every sound was like a high-pitched squeal and everything looked distorted. I tried several different anti-seizure meds before finding one (Lamictal) that didn't cause severe abdominal pain. I had a breakthrough seizure in June 2010 and one in early April 2011.

                In the last 9 months my 11yr old son has had 3 bouts of enlarged lymph nodes. Twice the abdominal lymph nodes and once the one in neck. This last bout was in the stomach with so much pain he could not be in a sitting position. I had him to ER 3 times in two days they said CT scan only showed mesenteric adenitis and said blood counts were all normal. So, therefore they only treated him with pain meds (lortabs). The time before was in the neck and face where he looked like he had mumps, They tested for flu and mono at that time said all negative. 
Any ideas as to what might be causing this.

                I am writing in concern for my nephew.  Basicaly, he has been ""ill"" for 3 weeks on and off. 

3 weeks ago, he broke out in some minor hives.  He was taken to the urgent care, and was told he had a mild temp. and that he must have a viral infection his body is reacting to.  Told to give him steroid and tylenol to break the fever. 

Well, on and off for the next week and a half, he gets a fever, but then it goes away.  He has a runny nose that won't stop running....and a cough (chesty, you can definitely hear ""junk"" in there).  His appetite decreases, but he's still eating some, but not like he was. 

Week #3, he's clingy, lethargic a few times, and still has the runny nose.  Chesty cough as well, but he doesn't cough often, but when he does...it's junky.    He's starting to look SKINNIER to me.  I'm guessing that in the past month, he's lost about 3-5 pounds, and it's noticeable.  Remember, his appetite has definitely decreased these 3 weeks of illness.  He'll eat a big/normal breakfast, but as the day goes on, it's hard to get him to eat much.  He just shakes his head ""no"" at just about everything. 

Notice his molars are coming in at this time, as well...not sure if that is causing any symptoms or not. 

The past 3 days, he broke out in a small amount of hives again, gave him the steroids immediately, they disappear.  Fever is back (low grade), still consistent runny nose (has yet to go away at all in this period), and still small appetite/looking skinny.  Now, he also has diarrhea, BUT....loves raisins and had been eating TONS of them the past few days. 

Not acting himself.  Grumpy/clingy/not as much energy, but not super lethargic either...will play and laugh and ride his horsey, etc, but just not ""himself."" 

IMMEDIATELY crazy aunt thinks ""it's leukemia""...... 

Are diarrhea, small appetite, runny nose, junky occassional cough, weight loss, intermittent low grade fevers a concern/red flag? 

For something as serious as leukemia?  what else could this be?  can a viral infectio last 3 weeks. 

One more thing...it should be noted that he LIVES in a house where daycare is ran (5 kids between 1-5 years old), and every kid lately is quite ill....all for about 3 weeks or so at a time.....cough, runny nose, fever, etc.  They don't seem to have the appetite/weight loss thing, though.

                I have a lump under my armpit it comes and goes and it is always sore but this time it's REALLY painful My bra rubs against it and makes it hurt more. It hurts when I touch it too. And it's gotten red. I did put a cooling pack on it and it took some of the pain out of it. My underarm hurts when I move my arm or raise it and I can't lay on that side it hurts pretty bad. I also get fiber cysts on my breasts every once in a while....could it be a Cyst? Please answer. I worried.

                Hi,

I'm new to this forum so I'd like to introduce myself briefly! My name is Peter and I'm 24 living in the UK. I've been on other health forums in the past both asking questions and trying to answer questions based on personal experience, although I am not in any way a medical professional, so I always qualify any advice I give with a statement to that effect.

My question relates to the recent discovery of two small lumps directly below my left armpit which are located - if I have my arm hanging by my side - about half an inch and an inch below the apex of the crease. The higher lump is slightly to the right of the lower lump and is about 3/4 of a centimetre in size, and the lower lump feels like two small lumps joined together of about the size width each.

These lumps first appeared just over two weeks ago and were at first very slightly tender but for the last week and a half have been completely painless to the touch. The lumps are mobile and are not particularly hard - I couldn't easily flatten them, but they do not feel rock solid. Having searched on the Internet, they are in the position of the bottom-most two lymph nodes as outlined in this diagram: http://medicalimages.allrefer.com/large/swollen-lymph-nodes-under-arm.jpg. When my arm is raised the lower of the lumps is aligned with my nipple.

I went to see my GP about them this morning and he thinks that they appear too low under the armpit to be lymph nodes but intends to refer me on to a haematologist (is that normal?) to have them further investigated.

I should probably mention that around the same time (before) these lumps appeared I did notice that I had a rather swollen insect bite (or perhaps slightly infected spot of some kind) on my back slightly under where my left nipple would be if it were on my back rather than my front. This spot has dried up and a scab has formed now, although evidence of the spot still remains visibly.

Does this sound like something that I should be worried about? In particular the fact that the lumps have been up for almost two weeks without being tender, and the lower of the two lumps to the touch seems to be formed of two small lumps joined together?

Thanks very much for your insight! If anyone knows whether there is a particular expert doctor on this forum who specialises or is able to give diagnoses in this field, please let me know and I will approach them directly!

Thanks again :)
Peter

                I am male, 23 years old. I started to find some bleeding spot on my right arm and left arm two months ago. Sometimes they are disappear and they will appear after 1 day. I went to see the doctor in our university, he checked that but did not say anything serious about it. 3 CBC were ordered from Jan to now, all the values were perfect. And Pt was also good. However, 3 Ptt were ordered from Mar. 1 to Mar. 28, all of them are slightly high, they were 37, 41 and 41 (reference level of lower than 35.2). The doctor told me that's normal, not all the people have values within the reference range. But he also referred me to see a hemopathy. He checked my liver and spleen, and said nothing wrong with them.

Today, when I was measured blood pressure by the nurse, a lot of bleeding spots appear in the area of the sleeve after measuring. And the hemopathy doctor today checked me and he had no idea about what are the bleeding spots are. He ordered a lot of test today, about 15 tubes of blood were taken from me. I am really afraid of leukemia, can anyone help me to check whether my symptoms are leukemia or not?

I had no fever. My nose was bleeding last week, but there was not so much blood, and it stopped soon.

                I went to my doctor today. he's a homeopathic doctor. I got tested with a aysra. if you guys don't know what that is it's like a test that reads through all your organs, nerves, tissues, blood etc; and picks up imbalances, virus, bacteria, fungal, etc. I was looking through the test and it said human t cell leukemia virus, under virus signatures. I did this test before a month ago, and that was not in the test. it says that it's ""balance"" and green, but the virus signatures are ""weakened"". does anyone know any information about the aysra testing and it picking up virus'? sorry if this is in the wrong section.

                Doctors have only seen my CBC and CMP results for different years separately and separately they look OK. I ordered them for myself for 3 years from different hospitals and I see distinct patterns. These are chronological for 3 years for 2009 2010 2011.

...... 2009 2010 2011
WBC 8.5 4.2 4.5 [Ref Range 4.8 - 10.8]

                Hi everyone im a 26 year old female and for the last year i have noticed several lymph nodes in my neck down both sides. I was feeling very run down about a year ago when i noticed them so i went to the doctors and they put me on antibiotics but they never went down my doctor just said some people do have palpable nodes and they are fine. Anyway its 1 year later and ive been searching online and it has really scared me reading about lymphoma so i decided to go back to the doctors and i voiced my concerns they didnt seem concerned but they said for my own piece of mind they would send me to an ent specialist. So far i have had a full blood count and a chest xray which were both normal. When i saw the ent specialist he didnt seem concerned about them but he said if i wanted he would send me for an ultra sound of my neck so i had that done and the doctor who did it said there were several but they were all within the normal size and nothing looked abnormal but he then said they cant be 100 per cent certain without a biopsy but he said they cant do a biopsy with everyone who comes in with swollen glands and because i havent lost alot of weight or been really ill he said that he is not concerned and doesnt want to send me for further testing. At this moment in time i am very worried from what i have read and its not like i just have one swollen its several and i feel like the doctors just think im mad. Anyones input would be reall good. thanks.

                Hi, 

I'm a 20 year old female and was diagnosed with Acute Lymphoblastic leukemia as a 7 year old and completed 3 years of Chemotherapy. 

Ever since I've hit my teens I seemed to have become irritable, easily upset, crying a lot and more. I have always put it down to hormones but lately I seem to becoming very anxious and almost completed stopped socializing. I feel worthless and like I'm not going anywhere in life, sad all the time and have been crying several times a day. I seem to have become very negative as family members keep pointing out that im alive and im (fairly) healthy and i should be happy. Logically i know this and it makes me angrier and even more upset that i can't feel this way. 

I'm wondering if there are any other people who seem to be going through the same thing?- several kids i went through chemo with have had similar feelings but not to this extent. 

Is there anything i can do to help? I cant seem to feel happy or have any fun anymore.

Blood tests came back normal.  Today I had an ultrasound and the guy who did it said he didn't see a lump on ultrasound at all (in fact, he found it difficult to find on palpation at all, despite it being a rather obvious lump - maybe not the world's smartest cookie?).  
I'm wondering how relieved I should feel... how accurate is ultrasound in determining abnormalities in the axilla?

                I have had some weird symptoms lately.  The doctor sent me for a CBC the other day and said all my results were fine.

How sure can I be that this rules out leukemia and lymphoma?  I've read leukemia or at least signs of it would probably register on a CBC.  As for lymphoma, I've read in some places that a CBC can be used to test and in other places that it would not necessarily show up on a CBC.  

Either way, how sure can I be that the clear CBC test means I don't have leukemia or lymphoma?  Is it rare that lymphoma could go undetected on a CBC or an everyday occurence?

I've had what I think is a slightly enlarged lymph node in my neck and some lower back pain.  This is what is making me concerned.

                Hi,

I just recently had a ultrasound to rule out lymphoma based on Dr finding lymph nodes in my neck and my right armpit. None of the lymph nodes are that big, but still noticable. He never told me which ones in my neck he felt, but just that there were a few. I have notced over the last 6 months or so that the lymph nodes under my jaw seem to stick out a bit. I have attached picture, if anybody knows whether this is normal for a 24 year old male or not. A couple of my guy friends do not have the same lumps as me when I left my head up. I can feel the nodes and they fill fixed and soft/rubbery, definately not rock hard which is good news.

Just wondering if anybody had any insight on this, thanks.

I also went to a ENT doctor he said the everything was ok. I have a burning sensation in my mouth that the ENT said it could be related to my tonsils. the only thing that scares me is the burning/itching sensation on my legs and the diarrehea. does lymphoma or leukemia cause this without being detected through ultrasound and a blood work ?

                my son
a few months to a year (in age) he started having large amounts of blood in his diaper when he would have a bowel movement.  after a couple days it would stop.  (doc didn't do any testing, said, ""probably hemmorhoids"" go home""

My son has always been a heavy sweater, even just sitting in a tshirt, but especially during naps and at night he would be drenched in sweat.   cold sweating actually.

I have been a stay at home mom for his entire life.  Only me taking care of him.  

He couldn't craw or roll yet.. nothin, no siblings here and yet he had 3 bruises on his legs that stayed for 4 months, they didn't change at all in color or shape.   Then one formed on his rib cage his left side.    

He has had random bowel movement bleeding up to the present, the last time three days ago.  and now last night he complained that his belly hurt, and he would point to a spot on his abdomen.

 and he still gets these huge bruises on his legs that stay for long time periods, and i don't know what is going on!

He has i'm not kidding, a respiratory infection (cough / cold) that has lasted 4 weeks he is just starting to get a little better.    The pattern is,  infection for 3 to 4 weeks, 1 to 2 weeks off, then infection again.  Random infections that bring high fevers that take him a long time to shake.  

My doc thinks i'm a looney.  I said, he bruises so easily and they last for weeks at a time sometimes months, and these nonstop infections, and random bowel bleeding.  
Doesn't think anything is wrong with him.  Didn't do any testing!!!  

I tried web md but all that came up was ""pre-leukemia"". .   

Added note, he has no pain ever when going to the bathroom.  

So can anyone tell me if these symptoms are anything i should be worried about or if i am a worrying mother for nothing like doc said.

                Im new here so bare with me.  I am very worried about my 3 year old daughter. She got sick in October. I thought she was getting the flu or something. She ran fever low and high grade for four weeks off and on, but mostly constatly. It started out like a bad cold or sinus infection.  Her pediatrician put her on antiobiotics, but she didnt respond to them at all. She started complaing of her legs feeling funny, a few days later started limping, then over night she couldnt walk b/c the pain was so bad in her legs and hips. We took her to ER at a childrens hospital. She was admitted and kept for 3 days. She was released with a ""leading diagnosis"" of discitis. Her sed-rate was 73 when normal is 5-10. The x-rays showed some narrowing in her disk space but the MRI was normal, so they were lerry about diagnosing her as discitis in the first place.  

She gradually started getting a little better over the next few weeks through November and beginning of December. Around Christmas she started running fever, which got up to 102.5 again with some congestion that lasted for a week. It went away and then the fever came back at the beginning of Jan. again. It lasted for another week. I took her to her pediatrician who couldnt find anything obvious wrong with her (ear infection, strep..) they did CBC and sed-rate test it showed normal and sed-rate was normal too.  A week later her fever came back again and lasted for about another week.

 Then the first week of February she told me her legs hurt again on several occasions and then she started running fever Again. So I took her to the pediatrician who put her on antibiotics again to see if it would help if it was an upper respiratory infection, but she didnt respond to them again.  

Her fever got up to 104.3 and wouldnt stay down very long with motrin/ tylenol so I took her back to the childrens hospital that she was orginally at. They admitted her on Feb 8.  Her fever stayed high the first 2 days (103-104.3), she complained of leg pains without a limp though, and her arms were slightly shaky like they bothered her.  They did a lot of blood work, x-rays, and an abdominal series ultrasound, and an EEG.  When hew fever would go down for 3-4 hours at a time, it was like she was a completely different child. She played and laughed, but as soon as the fever started climbing she would be very pale, droopy eyes, she would have episodes of blank staring, she only ate a few bites the entire week. Her fever finally broke the third night (after 8 days of continuous fever).  We were released on the 4th night in the hospital.  x-rays were normal, all her blood work was within normal range, except her Sed-rate was elevated back to 48.  Her ultrasound showed ""slush"" build up in her gallbladder, but nothing else.  Her EEG was normal. They tested her for several viruses, mono, cat scratch fever, and several other things. We saw several infection specialist, immunologist and several other people.  They sent us home and set us up a follow up appointment with the infection specialist 9 days later.  

She didnt run any fever within those 9 days but she did complain of her legs hurting, and she started stumbling around and fell several times without anything being  in her way.  We went to the appointment on Feb 20 in which he drew more blood, re-ran some her blood work stats, and told me to keep a journal of her for the next several weeks to documents all her complaint, and fever patterns.  Her CBC was within normal and her Sed-rate was down to 16. Then if all these blood test and such keep coming back normal and negative he will most likely set up a bone marrow test first week of April.  He told me he wouldnt need to see us unless something drastically changed or her fever stayed high for over three days.  

Tuesday, Feb 25 her temp started rising again but stayed between 99-100 all day.  Wed Feb 26 she woke up with 101 fever and it got up to 103 before I gave her motrin.  She compalined of her legs hurting again. She woke up all night long crying, she said her head hurt 2 times and she has another stuffy nose, paleness, and puppy dog eyes again. Her fever stayed through saturday. Then gradually started dropping in which it fluctuated between 100.4-99 to normal today. (Saturday evening).  We have an immunology appointment on Tuesday.

Besides her fevers her other symptoms include:   leg pains that come and go, appetite drastically lower, horrible night sweats (to the point we only let her sleep in panties because she is so drenched), starring episodes (a few times she told me everything was blurry), she falls frequently and randomly, She doesnt sleep throught the night she always wakes up crying several times a night, droopy eyes and paleness, random bruising and the bruises stay for a long time (she is not anemic they tested for that).  Her symptoms come and go.  Sometimes you wouldnt even know she was sickly, and other times she just lays around and wants to sleep and she doesnt even want to talk to anyone.

 I am very concerned because I have not been given any one diagnosis and they arnt sure if her discitis was related to what is going on with her now (which I personally think it is). She has been running these fevers going on five months. They said they know it is coming from somewhere but dont have any real answers for me yet.

I have been doing a lot of research and have a few questions about everything.  Could this be leukemia or something like it???????     Her white/red blood counts have been within normal, can you still get leukemia with normal counts?  The first hospital stay in Nov, it was on the low side of normal.  Just her sed-rate has been high 2 times before.  They looked into rhuematoid arthritis, but she doesnt have any rashes or noticeable swollen joints.  If anyone has anything similar or any advice or answers for me..please help!!  I have to miss work every other week to stay home with her.

                Hello, I am 16 years old and i have had a swollen lymph node behind my right ear. It is hard and moveable, and i have two in the back of my head, they are also hard and moveable. The one behind my ear is bigger then the other two. Anways, I went to my doctor and he felt them and he beilieves everything is okay and he doesnt think its anyting to be too concerend about. He did a physical exam and think their okay, just make sure their not getting bigger. I worry a lot about this kind of stuff. I have spermatocele ( cyst in testicles ) and ever since then i have freaked out about every little think on my body. Im so scared i have lymphoma or whatever and every thing else. My doctor check it out and said everything is okay and i could come back in a month for him to look at them again if makes me feel better so i said okay. I still just can not stop thinking about it. I have been reading the scariest stuff on here, and im constantly checking myself for every thing. My mom yells at me because she sees me messing with my body all the time. I know I should just listen to my doctor right ?. Thanks.

                I found what I thought  was just a simple zit on the labia (outside).I tried to pop it but it was painful and only blood came out. Since then my entire right labia has more than doubled in size. It is very swollen. I can feel bumps throughout the labia, they don't feel close to the skin at all. I also noticed a great deal of pain and swelling in my right groin. I can't even touch the lymph nodes in my groin area because they're so painful, it's also very swollen compared to my left. The nodes are much larger. 

Is this just a simple infection that will go away in a day or two or should I be concerned to the point of making an appointment to get it checked out? 

I'm a 35 year old female.

Thanks for any suggestions you could give me.

                Well i do not know if i should get a second opion or drop it...
In Nov of 2010 I noticed a Swollen lymph node in my neck on the right side and was not and had not been sick.  gave it a month to go away and when it did not i went to my physician.
So months go by it doesnt go down.  Physican just wants to watch it. Finally does an untral sound on it in end of jan.  before i get my results two more swell up.  one in right breast and one in right arm pit.  neck lymph node looks normal on ultra sound but he checks the one in my breast first of Feb.  Ultra Sound says it is a solid mass and needs mammogram.  mammogram says it is a benign lymph node.  So he says two months it should go away but if not he will refer me to a breast specialist.  that is next week.  Now i still have the swollen nodes in my neck and my arm pit and the one in breast feels a little larger and have no other symptoms.  Is a breast specialist who i need to see?  I am only 28, Breast cancer and lymphoma are both in my family and I feel confused and disregarded.  Should i pursue this or just drop it and hope they all unswell over time?

                Hi,

I seem to post alot in different forums on this site because i am a huge hypochondriac!! About a week ago i finally got the courage to see a doctor for another form of cancer i thought i could possibly have and Thank God the lump that scared me was nothing more than a harmless cyst! (ultrasound confirmed.) So now a week later a find myself worrying about yet another disease, this time after finding a HARD  PAINLESS MARBLE SIZE LUMP under my right armpit!

Now i read this could all be due to stress and especially since i dont remember this lump being there a month ago! But i take showers real quick so i might have missed it while washing. Who knows?! Anyway i have had a history with PAINFUL LUMPS in the armpit area for a while that come and go within a few days. All caused by the deodorant i used to use. And in the past i remember randomly getting hard marble size painless lumps in my groin area that i would ignore and eventually dissapear without me realizing within a few days. The only sign that i think is good is that at the beginning of the week the lump was HARD MARBLE SIZE and now its more of a HARD PEA SIZE. so it has shrunk which i read is a good sign. But other than that lump there is no other sign of lymphoma. So my question to any1 out there is, since i read it could take weeks or months for a lump to go away and since it already seems like this lump is shrinking, should i wait or be concerned. I really dont wanna go to the doctor AGAIN if i dont have to. This would literally be the 5th visit in 4 months! Insurance can only pay for so much.

                I noticed a swollen inguinal lymph node on my 2 year  old son in December. It was large, painless, and moveable. The Dr questioned the location, painlessness, and lack of any prior illness. She shrugged it off as bacterial infection (shes did initially question cat scratch disease but he has no access to cats) she ordered antibiotics with no success. She saw him again in 4 weeks and said it was slightly smaller in size so postponed labs. We were skeptical. The beginning of Feb he had  flu symptoms and was not eating or drinking for a couple of days with fever or diarrhea and office was closed so we went to ER. Here his labs showed low wbc, low rbc, low platelets, high lymphocytes, low monocytes, negative mono. We see her a week and a half later and he has lost 2lbs in spite of his appetite being completely normal the  day after the ER visit. He now has another large node directly above the remaining initial node.  He plays and eats normally but is now randomly vomiting every 3 days. His diagnosis in the er was bronchitis and he still has Runny nose and cough after a month and a half. The Dr is dismissing it as mono even though screen was neg due to false neg in children his age. I am worried...am I over reacting?

                Hey guys.
I'm not sure if I'm posting this in the right section, but here goes. Ok, so for the past 4 months I've had a TERRIBLE cough and an intense amount of mucus that caused costochondritis. It's still going on, so I plan on making a trip to the doctor; however, I have some more serious concerns I want to ask him about. I've got a lump on the right side of my upper neck (this one has been there for years) and just recently found one on the lower left side. I also have a hard one behind my right ear that's been there for years also. I found a hard lump on the inside of my right hip (kinda where my ovaries would be) about a year ago. Just thought I'd get some insight. I am 22 female and lack energy so much I've been to the doctor for it. I have daily neck pain and a frequently herniated disc that I'm going to an orthopedic doc for and intense migraines that have recently started to make me vomit (the last time I vomited 12 times) ...don't ask why I counted haha. 
Anyways, can anyone give me any insight? I don't want to just start thinking the worst, because I know reading anything on the internet needs to be taken with a grain of salt. I'm calling the doc tomorrow for an appointment just to get everything okay-ed! :)

                I am a 39 year old male, and recently I went for blood work.  My WBC was flagged as low.  It came back as 3.7.  I looked at my history for this and I noticed that it is slow coming down.  Back in 2007 it was 6.1, 2008 it was 5.9, 2009 it was 4.4 and this time 2011, 3.7.  

To give a little history, in 2007 I was very heavy.  I found out that I had diabetes and started to diet.  I wanted to lose weight, and not go on meds.  So I started to lose the weight.  Over the years I have lost 100lbs.  This weight lose coinsides with my WBC.  Gradully it started to go down as I was losing the weight.  Would me dieting effect my WBC?  My doctor doesn't seem to be concerned, so I guess I am just curious?

                The past 9 1/2 months have been a complete h3llride for me. This all started after a seemingly normal illness in may 2010 but has yet to end!

I will try to keep this as brief as possible. I just want input from someone, anyone else, other than the military hospital doctors i've been seeing.  I am convinced something is going on with my body, but nobody seems to have any answers for me. I keep getting referred to a different specialist for each individual complaint, but I feel like everything that has been happening is somehow related. I just can't seem to put the puzzle pieces together. I'll start from the beginning and add anything I can think of that is relevant.

I am now 21.

Began smoking at 16.

Had first child at 17 (quit while pregnant and resumed after birth). Healthy & full term.

Had an MRI in 08 that showed areas of non-specific white matter--said very early stages of demylineating condition could not be ruled out.

Jan 09, had dx Laparoscopy for weird periods. Found cyst on rt ovary and scarring around sig. colon.

Found out I was pregnant 1 week after surgery. Difficult pregnancy, preterm labor bouts--had healthy full-term baby Sept. 09.

Moved 3,000 miles, husband deployed for 7 months, did pretty well considering!


Had Mirena inserted April 2010, and a very, very large scale tattoo piece in March.





THEN! IT ALL STARTED!

May 2010, husband returned. I became extremely ill--sore throat, rt tonsil was HUGE, fever, etc. Fever and sore throat resolved, but I don't feel like I have gotten better since then.

Early June 2010--lymph node right under ear swells & is very hard. Dr says we should look further if it doesnt go away in a month.

Whole host of symptoms nearly too long to list develop & come and go randomly from June-Present.

*Headaches--Stabbing pains not lasting very long.
*Acne
*Pelvic Pain
*Itching Skin
*Nausea, randomly
*Crazy mood swings
*Easily winded.. walking up the stairs takes my breath sometimes
*Tingling and vibrations all over body, randomly.. Like electric shock
*Muscle knots, spasms, pain
*Ice cold hands and feet (they often turn almost black especially in cold)
*Very, very slow healing time
*Lower abdominal swelling--thought it was a hernia, CT negative. Protrusion, disappeared on its own.
*Palpatations
*EXTREME fatigue.. bed and couch ridden most of the time
*Easily bruised
*Neck stiffness
*Strange feelings in throat
*Ears ringing
*Double vision
*Numbess
*Dizziness upon standing, to the point of blacking out
*Insomnia, restless
*Extreme Hair loss
*Horizontal lines on toenails

Just to name a few!! No pattern to symptoms

Hump appears over lumbar spine in June. Appears swollen, not muscular related. Xray normal. No known injury.

Had various tests, ultrasounds, CT scans, etc. 

Early ultrasounds showed fluid around kidneys & liver. (March 2010 and August 2010)

They thought it was my gallbladder--had HIDA scan and it was only a few points off/modified diet as treatment.

Random and severe stomach pain in all quadrants, major attacks every few weeks. Bowels were fine, no problems could be found.

Ended up losing around 40lbs from may to August. Some was post-baby weight but it literally just fell off when I started feeling bad. 

Overwhelming fatigue and malaise continued. Tested for thyroid problems & mono, negative.

Had Mirena removed to make sure it wasn't causing the problems in Sept.

Periods regular after removal.

Went to ENT Sept 2010 to investigate lymph nodes. CT scan showed a few nodes with the biggest being 1x1.5cm I believe. Said to follow up in 4 months if any change.

Several strange events between Sept-Oct 2010, numbness, fingers tingling, chest pain, visual disturbances, etc etc. Not anxiety related. Went to ER once but wasnt a stroke. Dr's baffled.

Pap came back questionable Nov 2010. Due for a colposcopy, have not had one yet. 

Weird rash around Thanksgiving worth mentioning, appeared out of nowhere on my shoulder. Looked like ringworm even though we don't have any pets. Went away after about 4 days. Lyme disease came to mind (Live in Northwest) but I highly doubt it.

Strange appearance of new freckles in past 2 months. Appearing all over body and coming up in groups, almost like constellations. Most in straight lines ex: down my shin bone, in a patch on my stomach. 

Little pin sized red spots that look like blood blisters.

Constantly itchy even with lotion.

Now, in the past 4 months, my lymph nodes have gone crazy. I can feel them all up and down both sides of my neck, one above my right collar bone, in my armpits and on both sides of my groin. Most feel firm especially original one under my ear. Plan to call ENT soon to see about biopsy.

My biggest fear is Lymphoma, but i am not even sure how likely of a possibility that is. Next biggest fear is MS.

I am sure there is more but gosh, this was already so long. If you made it all the way through--thank you so, so much. I will appreciate greatly ANY input, advice, ideas, what have you! And if you need any more info just ask, I will be closely monitoring this.

I feel like I am going insane and just want this to end. I want my life back.

user_1273801,jr2648,/posts/Leukemia-and-Lymphoma-/Possible-Lymphoma-What-steps-to-take/show/1478355,Possible Lymphoma? What steps to take?,"
                First, let me state that this was written with no real structure in mind. I just let my mind flow out thoughts, as I have a few assignments due by tonight.

I am 21 and physically fit.

Symptoms started in December of 2009. Keep in mind, I had an aching neck that was tied to a tiny ""knot"" on the back-left of my neck. It is less than 1 cm, and has remained that size. At this time, I thought it was just a knot from tension and working out, but I'll bring this bump back up later. 

Warning: There are some graphical explanations, though I tried to keep it as limited as possible. Some of the beginning may seem necessary, but to anyone who likes to have a full history of symptoms, it is important.

In December 2009, I was working out quite a bit and was taking whey protein. After awhile, I noticed that my constant gas was a direct result of whey, so I decided to stop. Well, at about this point, my bowel function decided to plummet. I had always been very regular-- to the point that I would have a strong urge to go at the same hour every day if I had programmed myself to do it that way. I used to think I had a problem because the urge was so strong. Well, when my bowel troubles started, I basically stopped going for 3 days at a time. Since I had just started this new diet, I thought maybe it was my body's initial reaction, but it wasn't. After trying to revert back to my old diet, and increasing my food intake, my urge to go was still not anywhere near what it used to be. As you can imagine, this scared the heck out of me, but I didn't have any pain or signs of weakness so I decided to wait it out and see if I could manually fix anything. Well, after waiting about 3 months, I started having pain in my right-groin. After some further examination, I found my first swollen lymph node. It is very movable and of a rubbery texture. I have had issues with anal fissures, so I just linked it to this, but I figured a visit to a gastrointenstinal doctor would be appropriate. Well, the first doctor I saw ran a blood test to check for anemia and some other various things, and nothing came out. A few months later, I found more rubbery lymph nodes on the left and right side. Nodes that I had not noticed before. Hardly any of them are above 1 cm, except for this one that I just noticed on the right side, but they definitely weren't there before and they definitely were causing me this nagging pain after standing for a certain period of time.
At this point, I decided to see a GP with hopes of a different view. She stated that she thought they were what is known as ""Shotty"" nodes, but after some research I noticed that usually occurs when they all swell up and come back down, but these seemed to had just appeared.
She referred me to another gastro, and the gastro did a sigmoidoscopy, which was excruciating due to my unrepaired AF's, and said that due to him not seeing any inflammation on my blood tests or anything in the sigmoidoscopy, he was certain that there was nothing wrong. In fact, he and my gp both suggested that bowel habits ""change"" and that my case was normal. My GP also stated that since my lymph nodes didn't have any accompanying symptoms(night sweats, fever, etc), then she didn't feel like I should take the next step to test for a possible malignancy. I feel like this is extremely wrong. 

Well, after all this, I turned into quite a hypochondriac. I was to the point of researching my symptoms 4-5 hours at a time. It was bad. I got over it though.

During this time period of hypochondria(may-august 2010), I was put on lamisil tablets to cure a persistent nail fungus. In the 90 days I was on it, I pretty much had a loose stool throughout its entirety, and a month or so when I got off it, my bowel habits changed. I went from loose stools everyday, to unbearable large stools every 2 days. This lasted for several months until just 2 months ago I started having more normal sized stools every 2 days, but now I have the issue of the stool being very dry for the first 2 inches, and then normal following this. I still do not have a strong urge, but it is much improved since I lost my regularity in December 2009, but it bothers me that no matter what I do, I can't get that first portion to be not dry. Ive tried softeners, changing my eating habits, everything. I just don't know what to do.

Rewind back about 3 months from today's date, I start realizing that that bump on the back of my neck that I referred to earlier in my post has been intermittently hurting(on for a week, off for a week) since December 2009. So now, I'm linking this to the rubbery painful lymph nodes in my groin, but it's weird because the lymph nodes themselves don't seem to hurt-- it's the surrounding, and when I press on the node, it gives temporary relief.

Starting about a month and a half ago, I noticed that my left tonsil has been swollen for over a month without other symptoms besides an aching pain every few days, and now I've noticed another rubbery node on the left side as well-- right next to my jugular. What's really weird is I've only noticed new lumps such as this, but not any substantial growth.

Well, now we are to present time. I saw a new doctor just last week. She didn't even look at my tonsil, or listen to me about my intestinal troubles. She just felt one of the more predominant groin lymph nodes, stated ""wow that really jumps out at ya!"" and ordered me a blood test, which came back with normal results with ""a few outliers, but nothing to worry about"" My lymphocytes were slightly high and my ESR was 0(for the second time), but that's about it, so she ordered a Fine Needle Aspiration on my neck (she hasn't even felt it) to some outpatient business. They asked me which lymph node was being done, but I didn't know because she hasn't told me nor knows herself!

At this point, I'm very frustrated. I just want an accurate diagnosis. I want to know if I have a potentially life-threatening disease. That's it. And it really doesn't feel like any of my doctors are taking the right steps to check this out. I scheduled for the Fine Needle Aspiration on my neck(It's basically my referring doctor's points, and they stick it there), but I REALLY don't want to do this. After reading about it's inaccuracy-- I really don't want to waste my time or money here. What I really want is some sort of CT or PET Scan to check for possible lymph nodes in my intestinal area. This would explain my slowed bowel movements. I think a scan would also help to possibly determine if there are other nodes that are swollen outside of my groin and neck. If ANYTHING, I would like to just have them take out the lymph node on the back of my neck or tonsil to biopsy, that way that have a big enough sample size to make a diagnosis. What's a good idea for a next step?

Any suggestions as to my next steps would be VERY helpful. At the moment, I'm looking up local oncologists in hopes that maybe a specialist would be more appropriate for this. I'd really like to eliminate Lymphoma because it seems to be one possibility that sticks out in my mind.

Also, I am confused, why would the pain in my lymph nodes be intermittent? The nagging pain literally goes away for one month in my groin, and pops up in my neck for another, and vise versa. And though it seems to have gotten better(pain-wise) in my groin, now my tonsil occasionally hurts. What would physically be causing this pain? None of my nodes are even that big, they are just bigger than if they had no activity. And they don't seem to be growing, but they also don't go away. I've been trying to determine a cause, but I've eliminated all that I can think of (foods, deodorant, showering supplies, etc)

One other thing, the pain from my lymph nodes is never there when I'm sleeping or lying down, just standing up,sitting down, or have my head at a weird angle for long periods of time.

Thank you

                My 3 week old daughter was diagnosed with infant ALL.  I have recently joined a infant leukemia forum and am growing concerned b/c my daughter's presentation is not consisten with other infants with ALL.  

WBC: 75,000
all other cbc was normal

Presenting factor was that she had bruises from head to toe which they told us was leukemia under the skin.  They disappeared immediately following first does of steroids.  

The 1st bone marrow aspirate was not a great sample.

Claire's 2nd and 3rd bone marrows show no blasts in bone marrow.  2nd bone showed 0%MRD (3rd bone marrow was not evaulated for MRD). 

Could she of possibly been misdiagnosed?  All other infants had WBC of over 100,000+ - some even 500,000.  And, showed other symptoms such as amnemia and infection.

                Hi. I am a 43 year old woman with very few health problems up till now.  I have had 3 children and breast fed all three.  The last time I breast fed my daughter was about 1 1/2 years ago.  

About 2 months ago, I noticed a number of swollen lymph nodes that became increasingly painful.  These lymph nodes were located on the left side of my body only - my armpit, partway down my arm towards my elbow, the collarbone area, and right under the areola of my breast.  I believe that some of the lymph nodes in my groin might also be enlarged as well.  After a couple of weeks, they didnt go away, so I went to my doctor.  She found another enlarged lymph node on the right side.  She did some blood work and kept asking me if I injured my left side somehow.  I hadn't or at least didn't remember any injury.  The only thing I could think of was that I carry my (heavy) toddler on my left side and I do struggle lifting her.  Beyond that, I couldnt think of anything else.  The blood work all came back within the normal range...but meanwhile, as the weeks passed, the pain of the lymph nodes would seem to flare up and then subside a bit only to flare up again.  During the time (the last 2 months), I was feel extremely tired and seemed to catch a new cold every week practically.  I knew my immune system was run down but I put that down to some personal stress I was going through.  A few days ago, I had ""sinus cold-like"" symptoms, followed by flu like symptoms (which I still have) - sweats/fevers, chills - on again, off again.   Last week, I went back to the doctors and she is now referring me to a surgeon.  She hasn't ordered any more tests and I wont likely get in to see the surgeon for at least a few weeks. 

Today however, the pain in my lymph nodes was almost getting too much to take.  On top of this, I discovered today that the lump behind my areola had increased to the size of a ping-pong ball and was very painful as well.  I was feeling my absolute worst when I discovered the much larger lump in my breast.  As far as i know, there isn't any family history of breast cancer and the only cancer I know of was my father, who battled benign brain tumors (at first) which were operated on twice and on the third time, the tumors had become cancerous.  This enlarged breast lump has me worried, it seemed to get bigger very quickly.  The pain is also very uncomfortable.  I'm not sure if it is okay to use heat / cold on the enlarged lymph nodes to try and find comfort.  I have heard that it is not necessarily a good thing to ""stimulate"" lymph fluids but perhaps that is only an old wife's tale.  My doctor isnt telling me very much and says that she doubts that its anything serious but when you have several painful lumps including a large one in your breast - its hard not to worry or be scared.

I would appreciate any advice you could give.  Are they any tests in particular I should be asking my doctor for?  Is waiting a few weeks to see a surgeon wise when the pain is so bad?  To me, it seems like it might be.

Thanks in advance.

PS - Dumb questions time:  I have been under an very large amount of stress the last two years.  Can stress load affect lymph nodes?

                Hello, 

I have a question regarding my lymph node.  I have a lymph node in my groin area (Upper right side) that is bigger than my left one. they both feel about the same in size - maybe 1/2'' wide and 3/4 long, but the one on the right is more of a grape shape. Not as big as a grape but just round and the left feels more flat but some what raised.  I believe I have had this for as long as I can remember but I am not 100% sure on that.  I am sure it has been like this for over a year.  It has not changed in size, it is firm and it can be moved around with my finger. 

What are your thoughts on this?

                Hi all,

My 9 year old son has complained of minor leg pain...consistently in his left leg.  We took him to an orthopedist who did some blood tests and an x-ray (which showed nothing).  His LDH came back at 375.  Normal range is 130-300.  This was the only test that came back abnormal.  The orthopedist is recommending a bones scan, which is a radioactive injection and scan.  A friend of ours who is a hemotologist says there is no need for this or any concern.  He says that the LDH is typically elevated during growth spurts of children and that 375 is not an alarming number.  I don't know what to do.  I don't want to put my child through any unnecessary radioactive tests, but I don't want to overlook something either.

                My son is 23 months old and he got his first random nose bleed a yr ago. We took him to his family Dr and they did blood work and his platelets were in the 80's. His Dr said he had ITP and put him on steroids. After about 6 mos of regular blood work and when his platelets wouldnt go above 45 they finally referred us to a hematologist. At this time his spleen was enlarged, his platelets were averaging around 45, his hemaglobin was down to 8, he still had frequent nose bleeds and he bruised very easily all over his body. They thought he might have leukemia so they gave him a blood transfusion to raise his hemaglobin so they could do a bone marrow test. His bone marrow came back and there were no cancer cells but hes making to many blood cells which i guess are being stored in his spleen. They took his DNA and sent it to this mayo clinic and whatever they did with it came back normal. So the dr said it wasnt cancer and that she didnt know what was causing his symptoms. This was 2 months ago and she said she was going to start treating him symptomatically starting with IVIG which she never did. Well last monday i go to his regular checkup at his hematologist and she sits me down and says she talked to some dr in california and they think he has some rare case of leukemia. They are doing another bone marrow test next tuesday and they want him to participate in some study at the university of california, san fransisco. Im just so upset! I dont understand how one minute she says its not leukemia and then she has a conversation with this dr and now she thinks it is again? What did this Dr say to change her mind?! Im just wondering if there is anything else at all that it could be. He also has nystagmus and his eyes turn in when he looks to the left and right. His eye specialist said its not a lazy eye but something else and he needs eye surgery to correct it but we havnt been able to do it because his platelets are to low. He also started talking at a year old and about a month ago he just stopped talking. He used to say over 15 words and now he only says 4 and he just points and makes sounds. His frustration level has skyrocketed also. I dont know if that is related to what else is going on or if its something developmentally. Im wondering if i should take him somewhere else and get him a second opinion. I just dont know what to do. Any advice would be greatly appreciated, thank you!

CT scan looked o.k., as did an MRA.  Stroke was ruled out.  They thought it was possibly seizure so they gave her anti-seizure medication and then an EEG.  EEG showed no signs of seizure, however, once she started the anti-seizure meds, the symptoms stopped and she appeared to be normal.  No issues with her left side or her speech.
Her MRI showed some ""white spaces"" in her frontal lobes and the Dr.'s don't know what to make of it.  It doesn't appear to be in the normal spot of the brain if it was caused by the methotrexate.  Can anyone make sense of this?

About a month ago I felt a pea size lump under my left arm pit. It finally went away but then one came up under my right arm pit, about the same size. So, I changed deodorants. It went away. Now, I have a different one (different area) under my left armpit. It is hard and shallow and about the size of a pea and hurts to touch. I remember being sick with something about 6 years ago and my neck lymph nodes swelling and it didn't feel like this. Am I worried about ingrown hairs or a reaction to the deodorants I have been using, or does this sound like lymphoma or something?

                Hello,

I'm a 23 years old male.

About 6 months ago I noticed lumps in my groin area, they are hard and measure from about 2 to 3 cm. I wasn't sure what they were so forgot about them.

About a month ago I noticed a mole on the inside of my upper leg which had started to itch, has an irregular border and has raised, it is also 2 colours (brown and black). So last week I went to the doctors for them to take a look.

My GP has referred me to my local hospital to have the mole excised so they can perform a biopsy - my hospital appointment is next Thursday. Whilst with my GP i mentioned the lumps in my groin, he immediately asked how long the lumps had been there and said they were swollen lypmh nodes. He asked if they hurt or are tender, they don't hurt and are not tender. He asked if I get tired alot which I do and he also mentioned that I am under weight, I have always struggled to put on weight. With this information he sent me straight to the hospital for a chest X-ray to check for swollen lymph, nodes in that area and for blood tests - he said this way to check for lymphoma.

The chest X-ray came back all clear, the bloods didn't. The blood test was for complete blood count, bone profile, glucose, some viruses in the herpes family (can't remember which ones) and liver. The bloods came back with a high level of 'bilirubin' which I understand is due to the liver. The glucose part of test never came back.. Not sure why. I am back at the doctors on Monday so they can take abother blood test to check bilirubin levels again.

My GP said my symptoms are similar to lymphoma. I asked if the lymph nodes could be swollen due to the mole (its only a couple of inches away from the lyph nodes) and if it could be melanoma. He doesn't think the mole is melanoma and so has not caused the lymph nodes to swell, but wants to rule that out with the mole biopsy.

So with my chest X-ray clear, my blood only showing a high level of bilirubin, and me always feeling tired, does it sound like I could have lymphoma?

My GP hasn't asked me to come back and see him yet - he called with my X-ray and blood results yesterday. Do I need to go and see him about the lymph nodes again or should I wait until I get the mole biopsy results?

My GP said the lymph nodes are unlikely to be swollen due to a infection - they are not tender, I have no infection symptoms and the blood test didn't show any infection (White cell count normal)

One last thing, leukaemia (CLL) runs in my family but since my white blood cell count came back normal would leukaemia be ruled out?

Sorry about all the questions and thanks for your help, I'm just really worried.

                Hello. 

I just thought i'd post on here to see if anyone could help me with some questions I have. 
I'll give you a quick overview, promise i'll keep it short. 

I am a 22 year old female, generally good health, weight, non-smoker etc. This time last year I noticed a swollen lymph node under my left ear, near the end of my jaw. It was about an inch across and 1.5cm in length. It didn't hurt at all, unable to move it, and could see it under my skin. 

For months I had extreme tiredness, no amount of sleep seems to cure it. No other symptoms, no sign of an infection etc. 

I had blood work done, general CBC and HIV tests, all negative. Also, a chest x-ray was performed, which was clear. 
Doctors felt like a biopsy wasn't needed. 

Now, a year later, I still have that lump under my ear, which I've grown to just accept. But a few days ago, I noticed that another lump in my throat has appeared. But it's right in deep inside my throat, in the centre, I can feel it if I touch and it's slightly painful, but more like an ache than a sharp pain. As far as I know I'm not ill, I haven't had a cold in about 9 months and I never get a sore throat.

So I'm just wondering really whether these two things could be related? Could it be another swollen lymph node? Is it something you'd recommend getting checked out? I don't even know if I have lymph nodes in the main, integral part of my throat!

I don't want to sound like a hypochondriac, but i'm curious and a little worried. A second opinion is always needed. 

Thanks :)

                Just returned from a deployment from the middle east.  Was exposed to a fair amount of blood, and possible HIV/ Hep exposure.  Was tested at 25 days and was neg.  now 5 months after am being tested again and awaiting results for HIV.  about a month ago had swollen lymph nodes in neck, and a persistant dry cough.  antibiotics knocked this out in about a day.  When getting my tests my cbc indicated a slightly low WBC 4.6(5.0-10).  My concern is that last year at this time my WBC was in the high 8's.  Over all I feel good, just tired after a long trip. 

My questions: 1: Will stress and sleep depervation cause a slightly lower WBC.
2: If antibiotics decrease your lymph nodes and cough, can I assum it was a bacterial infection.
3: Understanding that 25 days is not enough time, and knowing I am waiting on new test results, can HIV or Hep have an such a minimal effect on WBC at about 5 months.

Thanks

                Hi,

I'm not quite sure if this is the right forum but I'll ask away.

Last week I developed an Infection on my lower left wisdom tooth and have been to the dentist. 2 days or so after it developed and became very sore I noticed a swelling of my left gland in my neck and was wondering if this is a normal thing to expeience with such an infection. I have no other swellings of glands anywhere else.

But, since I had the swelling of the gland I've also had very bad night sweats, something with I've never really had before. Very rare. I've woken up in the morning the past few days since I've had the infection and swelling of the gland and the bed has been litterally drownded.

I'm wondering if it's possible for this to be releated to the swelling of the gland and / or the infection to the wisdom tooth on my gum.

Any help is much appriciated. Thanks.

                I have a child that came into the pharmacy that went to the ER with a little bit of pain in his stomach area. He came in yesterday with a sinus infection and doctor gave him an antibiotic. Mom also noticed a trace amount of blood in urine. Took a urine sample into doctors office. Last night at 1 AM went to ER and did some test on him. he came back with a low creatinine levels, low lymphocytes, high seg, high monocyctes, trace amount of protien maderate blood and the RBC and WBC are high also. Is there anything the mom needs to worry about?

                I am hoping someone might be able to help me understand some things. I was diagnosed with MS a year ago and have been handling that pretty well. But since Sept., I have been having alot of unexplained things going on. They are:
Increased heart rate
feeling full quickly
unexplained bruising popping up everywhere
hair loss
petechiae
night sweats
Those are the main ones I can think of right now. My PCP sent me to a rhuemy thinking it might be lupus. They thought so as well but then all blood work came back normal so they dismissed me. Now I am wondering if it could be leukemia. Had blood work the other day and nothing was extremly off. 
MCHC 31.5 (L)
MPV 11 (H)
baso%  2.3 (H)

That was pretty much it but I have copies of all bloodwork over the last year and was compairing and it's like 1 month I'm anemic and my WBC's are high and the next month everything is normal. It just seems to go up and down all the time. I also noticed that my platelets have increased everytime. They were at 240 almost a year ago and now they are 321.

Sorry this is so long. I am just looking for advice.
Thank you

                Hi, I am having some symptoms that appear similar to those I've read about for lymphoma, and I'm hoping you can shed some light. They are:

-Swollen lymph nodes on the lower left side of my neck for about 6 weeks (an ultrasound 1 month ago showed 4 nodes, largest was 1.4cm) - i can feel a lump in my throat as a result.
-Swollen, painful lymph nodes running up the right side of my neck for about 3 days now. they feel about 1cm and firm, like a bean (but they move).
-Intermittent chest pain, right side, just under the rib cage for about 3 months.

I have had a CAT scan of the chest/liver area which came back normal. Also, I had Thyroid cancer 10 years ago, and had a total thyroidectomy. So far thyroglobulin tests have come back negative (no indication of Thyroid cancer recufrrence). 

I am scheduled for another ultrasound today, and I am scared. Can anybody give me any guidance on how worried I should be about lymphoma or some other serious disorder?

Thank you.

                Hi all,

Back in July, I had an ultrasound done to rule out lymphoma due to enlarged lymph nodes in neck/armpit. The armpit ultrasound showed a 2.4cm x 0.5cm x 0.5cm lymph node. It still had intact hillum, but the mantle zone was thickened.

I had a biopsy in August, but it was inconclusive. My doctor decided to wait 6 months for an U/S.

I just got the results back and the report said that there were no lymph nodes seen. My doctor and I were both confused because we saw the images ourselves and it clearly showed a lymph node that was highlighted with measurements. Also we had the radiologist worksheet, which said ""Lymph node found in right axillae is 2.5cm x 0.7cm x 0.8cm. Node appears to be heterogeneous."". My doctor has asked the radiologist to recheck the images and produce a new report.

I'm confused, why would the radiologist put that on their worksheet if it was not there. Also, even an untrained eye could see the highlighted lymph node on the screen. Also, does anybody know what heterogeneous lymph node means? I know what hillum means, but not that. 

Thanks.  :)

                can thyroid cancer turn to lymphoma? Or can you go into remission from thyroid cancer and then get lymphoma? Is it possible to have them both? This is very confusing.

                I wanted to ask a personal question if I may.  What were your blood count levels when you found out you had leukemia/lymphoma? 

The reason I ask is that I'm increasingly worried, my Dr has been very slow with my blood work up, I've been monitored over months but I'm feeling worse but they're still making me wait - typical NHS (UK health service).

I don't know if the values are different in the US, but my Neutrophil count began in July at 1.1, it came up to 1.4 in September, October it was 1.4, November it was 1.5, December it was 1.67, I've just had tests again and it is still low.  I am also anemic but ""borderline""  (11.4 and normal here is 12 upwards).  I lost a lot of weight a few weeks ago despite eating normally.  I have not been bruising badly, in fact my platelets were normal.  My lymphocytes were up in November but normalised again in December.  My temp has been up and down, I've monitored it myself and this week it has been perfectly fine but today it came up again a bit.  I've been feeling generally exhausted for these past months, I'm pale and thin and just generally ache all the time.  

Last week my partner discovered a growth, he said it was a hard lump, the size of a grape, and it is inside me (I will not say where, I'll just leave that to the imagination).  I've also had bleeding and pain down there also.  I was put on the Depo injection to stop between period bleeding but it started up again 3 weeks into the injection, around the same time as I was getting discomfort down below.  

My grandmother died of Leukemia, my aunt recently died of Lymphoma related complications.  I remember my mother telling me that my grandmother had Leukemia and also had bleeding and was having to wear pads all of the time.  Now I seem to experiencing similar but my Dr won't look further into it.  I have another appointment next week to have this growth looked at, to have swabs and a repeat smear test.  

I must sound like a hypochondriac, I'm just terrified.  Before I gave birth in May last year my white cell count was always perfect, though I was borderline anemic but they put that down to pregnancy at the time.  

I have now a 9 month old baby daughter whom I love and I just have no energy at all.  I am also feeling very depressed because I keep thinking I have cancer.  Every time I look up Neutropenia with anemia it pops up with lymphoma or leukemia.  I've tried to request a biopsy of bone marrow but they want to monitor me over the next 3 months!!!  I've seen more than one Dr in that office and they all agree with each other and have even offered me antidepressants.  But I keep bursting into tears wondering if I'm going to get to see my girl grow up.  It seems the medical profession here doesn't care.

As a means of knowledge I would just like to know if low neutrophils with borderline anemia would indicate cancer?

                I'm going to be as brief as I can and would like some advice if you can help.

7 weeks ago I got poorly with some kind of ""viral infection"" so the Dr called it.  I had a slightly scratchy/prickly throat, but my lymph nodes were NOT swollen at the time, I developed a temperature and felt achy, sleepy and weak, I also had a tickly dry cough.  In week 1 the Dr took a look and diagnosed viral tonsilitis (as I had spots in the arches just before my tonsils), then I went back a few days later feeling worse and he gave be antibiotics the antibiotics made me even worse though I carried on with the course.  My throat/arches felt hot, the sort of sensation you get from eating very spicy food when it burns your throat so not like a regular sore throat, just a prickly feeling, sometimes it tingled and not constant either.  By week three I was back at the Dr's office feeling still this same but this time I had developed night sweats and would wake in the morning with sweats and feeling over heated.  I was sent for mono spot test and CBC and bone profile.  Results came back and I was told I had Mild Neutropenia which I have had since July but it was slowly coming back up to normal (1.1 in July and up to 1.67 in December), my lymphocytes had been also a little low the month before but were back to normal (I was having monthly tests done because I am anemic).  I noticed by week 4 that my lymph nodes had swelled up and were tender and I was back at the Drs again, this time they were getting annoyed with my being here.  They tried telling me it was viral and to go home and rest.  They were not worried by my blood results and told me they wanted to check it over three months.

It is now week 7 and I'm still poorly.  In the morning the nodes under my earlobes are very tender, I have two nodes in the side of my neck that are up but not tender, the nodes on the back of my neck/head are tender and my underarm ones are tender but not swollen.  They appear to be tender then not tender throughout the day.  My temp also goes up and down through the day.  I'm still fatigued and weak and I lost over 14lbs in weight when it began, I'm pale and my eyes look heavy, I have no energy and all I want to do is sleep.  I have had mild neutropenia since July and I gave birth two months before that, so I have a baby to look after too, I'm just so exhausted and not getting better.  I also now have white patches in my mouth and bald patches on my tongue since this started up, I have a white patch on the side of my tongue that will not go and these spots in my throat are still there but have faded a bit.  They're not like normal tonsilitis spots, they're really small.

I'm hoping it is just mono and that the test was done too early to tell or something.  My aunt died from NHL last year so it is in the family and I am very worried.  I do have a swollen non tender lymph node under my jaw on the right which came up during a bout of mumps and never went back down again, this was a few years ago, but it has been tender recently whilst I've been poorly.

My blood work is pretty much normal apart from my being borderline anemic and mildly neutropenic, but I cannot understand why my glands won't go down, and why I'm getting night sweats.

                Hello,

I never thought that I would be posting my symptoms online to try and get input from other people but I am feeling a bit hopeless when it comes to finding an answer as to what is going on with my health. So, I need some good advice. Here is the run down of what has been occurring:


About two years ago I started having heavy night sweats about 3-4 times a week. I have to change my clothes 3 times a night at times. I sleep with a fan, very light clothing, and a very light blanket. 

About a year ago I noticed that I was using the bathroom alot to urinate but only in the last week did I find out through doing intake and output measurement that I am having an output of about 3500mls-4000mls a day when I only drink like 2500-2800mls a day. My doctor asked me to do this intake/output measurement. 

I have noticed since September that I have grown very tired and have a decreased amount of energy. I still pushed myself to go to work (I am an RN).

About a month ago I had a episode where I was vomiting every hour for twelve hours straight. My husband also threw up a couple of times. I also had extreme pain throughout my body especially in my lower back. I ended up staying two nights in the hospital where they took my appendix out even though it wasn't inflamed. However, it was adhered to my abdomen. They did say that I had free fluid in my abdomen from an unknown source which they believe is what caused my pain. 

Since the surgery my fatigue has worsened two-fold, I have developed palpitations, SOB with little exertion (such as brushing my teeth), chest tightness and SOB just when going from a standing to squatting position, dizziness, randmon leg and arm aches, leg weakness (feels like legs buckle sometimes), sharp random pains behind calf and thigh,  random tingling in my toes and fingers, dull headaches everyday, right eye lid droop, random moments of jumbled words or difficulty finding a word, orthostatic hypotension, HR that on average increases from 70bpm when lying to 115-120 within less than a minute upon standing. Yesterday I had a occurence of ringing in my ears after I felt a pressure release in my ear. The other morning for ten minutes my left side hurt everytime I took a breath. 

Recently (the last three days) my orthostatic hypotension seems to be better however the HR is increasing the same and the diastolic is coming over 90 when I go from a lying to standing position. 
Last couple of days my BP has been 102/90, 98/90, 119/93...My systolic drops as I stand and my diastolic rises greatly.

All of my blood tests have come back negative (CBC, BMP, Cortisol, Aldosterone/renin, liver enzymes...), my CT scan was normal, my EKG is normal, my EEG is normal. I am still waiting on results from my ECHO, ultra sound of the kidneys, and 24hr urine test. I am scheduled to have a MRI soon. 

I have been out of work for a month. Before the surgery I was exercising three days a week, working three days a week, and I eat healthy. I don't smoke, drink, or use any kind of drug. I have cut back GREATLY on caffiene intake so as to try and rule that out as a cause for palpitations. Cutting back has not yet helped it though. I am a 23 year old female with a good health history. All of my immediate family members are healthy. 

I have been taking Synthroid for about 2 1/2 years now for mild hypothyroid.

Sorry for this long message. Any thoughts?

                My son's pediatrician felt a small lump on my son's chest. We brought him in initially because my wife was concerned with ""flushing"" in is face. What was happening with that is when my son played video games for like an hour, his ears would get warm & red. I believed it was normal when he gets excited from the game and it is the only time it happens. It should be noted that since the examination, neither my wife nor myself are able to feel this lump. So, the Dr., who has a nasty habit of being very dramatic (sent us to the ER for what he said was a fatal virus - turned out to be hives) ordered blood work. Initial work a week ago showed LDH levels of 197. We went again on Friday to get specific tests for Leukemia & Lymphoma and the LDH was up to 223. My wife is hysterical and the Dr. wants to order a Biopsy. All without even getting the results from the specific tests we had done, those won't be back for about a week.

So, my question is, should I even really be that concerned? Can anyone help with their thoughts on this?

Thank you so much.

                Hi everyone, I was hoping anybody could help shed some light on my problem, or maybe if anyone has even been in a similar situation after another cancer?

I'm a 25 year old female, normal weight, and have not been healthy for a long time.

I had follicular thyroid carcinoma, and a hurthle cell adenoma with chronic inflammatory change. But now I am concerned about lymph nodes and secondary cancer.  My Thyroglobulin levels are 0.2, undetectable, so I am pleased with this result after I had radioactive iodine in late July.

For the past 3 months or so, I have noticed a lymph node on the left side of my neck, in the middle between the base of my skull and collarbone, and towards the back of my ear.  It didn't concern me at first, but I keep getting a bad cough, and a red throat, so I have been diagnosed by my GP with ""pharyngitis"" 3 times in 3 months, the 2nd time I had a fever of 38C-39C for a week while taking Amoxicillan, and then Keflex.  They thought I had pneumonia because of the fever and chills, but an X-ray of my chest was never conducted.  Slowly the symptoms wore off, but the lymph node did not.  I have now got the same thing again, a few weeks later. My CBC is normal, but my Vitamin D is only 26, I am now taking 2,000 IUD a day.  I also have itchy thighs that will turn red, and then goes away, but they have told me this is probably an allergy.

The lymph node is about 2 cm big my GP has said that this is not normal, I have now felt a smaller one in a similar place on the ride side, and something firm under my right armpit which causes discomfort when I press on it.  I am scheduled for an Ultrasound on Friday.

I'm sorry for the long-winded post, but my question is, has anyone ever had lymphoma after thyroid cancer or any cancer? Am I at a higher risk for lymphoma? This is obviously not thyroid cancer related, as I've had my Thyroglobulin levels checked.  I should also mention I have had Glandular Fever (mono is the U.S term?) when I was 17, and this does not feel the same.

Best wishes and love to all.

I seem to ache everywhere and have strange sore areas on my stomach although no actual pain inside the abdomen.

                OK, I got ill the day after Mother's day last year, and that ended me in the hospital for 4 days (diarrhea but it was only blood, not feces). Bloodwork, xray, CT scan, gastroscopy, endoscopy, ultrasound, and no answers. Platelets are steadily getting higher (testing every 3 months) currently at over 700,000. WBC is above normal, suggested I take Aspirin. I also have Petechiae all over my body, with newer ones showing up all the time, and I wake up with bruises. 

Since then, I've been losing weight (20lbs since mid-Nov), I'm very tired, and weak, and now have edema in my legs, hands and feet. 

I've had diarrhea for a week now, and am on a waiting list (August is the soonest they can get me in) to see a hematologist for a Bone Marrow Biopsy. That's too long to wait, in my opinion. 

I am having to take 40mg Lasix daily for the water retention, and it doesn't help, my urine output is very poor. 

I am frustrated, and worried, because my symptoms are that of Hodgkin's almost to a ""t"". Do you have any suggestions? 
I'm 37, have had 3 kids, a complete hysterectomy 12yrs ago, and have Fibromyalgia. I'm also a smoker, and have numerous allergies.

                Sorry, this is so long!  I had routine blood work done and found that my WBC was 22000.  This was 7 weeks ago.  Since then I have had other blood work and test done.  The WBC has stayed between 12500 and 22000. Tested almost weekly, it went from 22000, 12500, 14000, 14700 and 14000.  Found that my calcium level is high and Vit D low. Sed rate normal.  Have had ultrasound and CT on kidneys (stone prodical), which was normal.  Chest x-ray was normal.  Had an Ultrasound on thryoid, it showed 3 cyst.  (blood work for thyroid was normal) Also have microscopic hematuria, which I have had for a few years.  Seen a urologist, who did scope and cytology, this was all normal.  Last summer I had a bone density scan, and it did show bone loss in hip area.  I am a 44 year old female.  Had total hysterectomy 1 1/2 years ago.  Thought I was in good general health.  I have tendonitis in my ankle that dont want to heal.  Have seen podiatrist for awhile now.  Have had rectal bleeding (small amount) on TP 1 time a few months ago.  Have had issues with anal itching for several years, that I was always told was nothing.  I have had a few spells of severe pain and sweating with bowel movements and a few spells of major stomach pain (what felt like trapped gas) that lasted for several hours, this has happened a few time over the past few years.  Nothing else at all that I can think of.  Have an appt with gastroentologist in 2 weeks.  Have never had a colonoscopy.  Dr did do a rectal exam and said he didnt feel anything, but could feel some swollen tissue (could have been from all the irratation from scratching?)  Im at a loss here and its driving me crazy!  Here is the first and only results from blood work I have on hand.

                My husband has Acute lymphocitic leukemia, and is currently having problems with his liver, he has a sweet smell in his mouth, is very thin, yellow, and his eyes are yellow too. Is confused, his character has changed completely, he is now agressive, and angry all the time. He has become abusive, and threatenning. He is cold to the touch, has an enlarged belly, sometimes doesn't know if it is day or night. Is walking with his legs spread apart, and is trying to find balance with his arms, it is going to sound terrible, but he is walking like a monkey. I would like to know what to expect from here on, I know that because of the many ports he has had in the past he is not a good candidate for dialesis, please help. I would like to be prepared.

                How do I begin? Well it all started about four months ago when I was at work (I was working at a saw mill) when I noticed a bit of pain shooting down my jaw, I thought nothing of it and kept on working, about 3 days later I start having heart populations, but I didn't seem to worry about it too much and just thought ""ah well it's just because of how hard I'm working"" and shook it off, the problems just seemed to be getting progressively worse! the next symptom that would occur would be massive amounts of fatigue, and following that I noticed the glands in the right side of my neck were slowly getting larger; I held off going to the doctor at the very last minute, due to being a temporary employee waiting to become permanent. and that's when the next symptom came, my neck swell up so much I was actually having a hard time breathing and among that, the mysterious chest pain... after this I went into panic mode and went straight to the E.R when I was asked a series of questions and hooked up to some kind of heart monitor where they stick a bunch of sticky patches with wires on various parts of your skin and the nurse instantly looked distressed and told me my heart wasn't pumping the way it should so they discovered the sack around my heart was swollen and diagnosed me with viral paricarditis I believe it is called, told me I just had a cold gave me some antibiotics and sent me on my way. and various different tests later (MRI)(Chest X-RAY, Chest CT,Blood test for mono blood test for lyme disease, pee test for diabetes and a few others I cannot recall right now..... so here I am going bankrupt due to all of these tests that they are running on me and they can't find a single thing wrong besides the swollen glands in my neck and the riboflavin or whatever it is called in my liver being elevated also my thyroid, I don't understand why they didn't just due the biopsy on the glands in the first place considering how long they had been swollen before even going to the doctor.(Biopsy my idea) but he insisted ""oh no we don't usually need to run those sort of tests in younger patience""  what are people 20 and below immune to cancer or something? anyway I know my grammar and punctuation is horrible I'm sorry I just would like to know if I'm dying or not I am constantly tired, the glands seem to get smaller with rest I have had 2 HIV tests both negative including gonorrhea and syphilis both negative and I'm going on 5 months now and now I'm losing hope and trust with everyone because there's something seriously going wrong inside of me I can feel it..... but we are only able to find clues not answers, I am not asking you to diagnose me I am simply asking for a list of possible diseases that I may have if they're serious post them I've suffered long enough and if I have cancer I should be able to handle it. Thank you and please help me. =( Tests ran (HIV x2, Syphilis, Gonnorea,Lyme,Blood X2,2 Chest X rays, CT scan of chest and head. MRI of head,EEG of head. All normal besides liver and thyroid.
Symptoms From beginning to end: 1. Chest pain (came and went every other day) 2. Jaw Pain 3.Very tired (Had to quit my job because of it) 4.(3) Swollen Glands on right side of neck only get bigger when active, smaller with rest. 5. Coughing up blood/and/or infected mucus from my lungs. 6.Paricarditis. 7. muscles spasms. 8. fibre mialga (Pre existing from last scare 3 years ago) 9.Numbness in right hand only also right foot only (I also always have cold hands/feet weather it be warm or cold outside) people always tell me wow, you're hands are very cold (Kind of worries me) 10. pain in my neck. I would also like to add that my wisdom teeth are coming in if that helps any. and Again I am very sorry for my typing. I'm very scared and have been for the last 4 1/2 months... Please I am begging someone from the bottom of my heart that has any experiance in the medical field or even maybe some suggestions please give me some ideas what could be wrong with me. Thank you all and God Bless.

                Hi my name is Lisa. I had tonsils out @ 8 yrs of age. In Nov 2010 had Titanium Plate placed in cervcal. Since that time I have felt something in my throat when I swallow. Contracted bacterial infection from surgery. Antibiotics did nothing PCP sent me for CT scan w/contrast of the soft tissue. Because my splien was removed back in the 80's I now have immune disorder and that concerned PCP white count is 15000 and has been on the last 2 cbc blood test. PCP checked my throat to be sure tonsils didnt grow back states he sees something on the base of my tongue but states we have 2 sets of tonsils 1 upper and 1 lower and feels there is a mass on the lower that may not have been completly removed. My CT results read lymphoid tissue of waldeyers ring are inlarged including tonsils which is nonspecific and could be secondary to infection. Idiopathic causes and lymphoproliferative disorder. Right low level ll lymph node measuring 1.5 cm greatest long axis dimension is upper limits of normal size no other evidence of lymphadenopathy.. Is this in english???  So I have been refered to the ENT. I read up on Lyphoproliferative disorder and I tell you I am terrified...  Also per my blood test I have anemia and low B12 levels and started B-12 shots immediatly. So any advise for me. Anyone.. What is this? Cancer? Do I die now?     Any help would be greatly appreciated.. THIA..

                I have a lump in front of my neck which the doctor says could be caused by a virus or could be lymphoma. The glands in my shoulder, stomach area and groin are not enlarged. I have occasional discomfort (ache) in my sternum area and have observed various red blotches, from time to time, on various parts of my body.

Initial blood test results revealed no worrying features but suggested a viral infection but further blood tests are arranged. 

The specialist wants to leave me for a fortnight to see if the lump reduces or goes away. I am feeling stressed and would appreciate your view on my condition

                Good afternoon,
Im not sure where else to turn so I thought I would try this group.  For the past 3 months I have been living in complete terror and have convinced myself that I have some form of malignancy.  I have had scattered petechiae each day all over since October.  Each day there are new dots in different areas.  I have become overly obsessed and each day I see a new one the fear goes through the roof. I have seen numerous doctors and have three CBC's, Von Willdebrand (spelled wrong Im sure), been tested for multipl viruses, platelet function test, and a few others tests run.  I have other symptoms as well such as slightly palpable lymph nodes in front of both ears, side of neck, and under chin (which I have had an ultra sound of and was told they they are within normal size range), burning in lower abdomen, burning all over at night while trying to sleep, insomnia, and an inability to gain weight.  I have seen multiple doctors and specialists and although they have run tests the majority tell me I need to get my anxiety under control.  I would believe that my anxiety could cause most of these symptoms but not the petechiae which is the sources of my complete terror.  Im not sure what answers I am looking for but I am just searching for a way to get my life back.  I am going to see the hematologist again tomorrow and will ask her to run test for autoimmune illnesses and possibly bone marrow.  I dont know if there is anything else I should ask her to run.  If anyone has any thoughts or suggestions, I would greatly appreciate it.  Thank you very much!

                Hello, 

I am a 20 year old female, healthy other an underactive thyroid diagnosed May 2010.  About a month ago I noticed a lump in my thyroid region.  To make a long story short, I went through testing and bouncing back between thyroid nodule and parathyroid adenoma only to determine it was a reactive lymph node.  It is .75 cm in size and located posterior and inferior to the left side of the thyroid.  The biopsy showed that the lymph node is reactive.  Submental nodes appeared to be inflamed on a CT scan, but were only a few millimeters in size. 

Should I be worried?  I was on a Z Pack for 5 days and it did not decrease in size at all. The doctor said I can remove it now or wait two months to see if it stays.

                Hi there, 
I'm a 27 y/o female, 5'3, 55kg, unmarried, no boyfriend, I've been really healthy but for the past 2 years, its been really disturbing. 
2 years back, I had high fever, took many blood tests, but no results. Days passed and I got better and I passed it as a viral fever. A year back, I had really high fever with night sweats for 3 whole days. I had no help, so had just warm water and felt better on the 4th day after some electrolyte. I felt very weak then, and lost some weight too. 
1 year later, I had really bad pain in my upper right abdomen. The pain would radiate towards the back; felt like a stick passing from front to back. It went for around 3 days when I could feel the pain while eating anything. On the 4th day, i was better, but lost lot of weight and looked really frail. I noticed that while running or carrying heavy items, the pain would start again. However, this pain is not consistent, everytime I run. 
3 months back, I noticed that my menstrual cycle was not proper and after 4 months of no cramps, I was prescribed 'meprate'. On taking an ultrasound, 

Reports said: 
A hypoechoic lesion measuring 3.7 x 3 x 3 cms is seen at the porta hepatis. Few cystic areas are also seen within the lesion. No vascularity seen. 
USG of neck: Multiple[ = 6-8] lymph nodes are seen on the left side of neck, some may appear cystic. Largest lymph node measure 12x8 mm and 13x7 mm. 
Impression: Lymph node is seen at the porta hepatis. Another small lymph node is seen in the para aortic region. Cervical group of lymph nodes are seen on left side of neck. 
Chest Xray: Normal 

I've started getting acne on face even though I didnt have it at puberty.
I'm not sure what is wrong. 
Please help!! 
Thanks in advance!!

I had developed a large swollen lymph node on the right side of my neck almost a year ago which a CT confirmed. Since then I have had multiple infections, breathing difficulties etc. In the past week I have noticed smaller swollen lymphs either side on my collarbone and then discovered three large swollen lymphs behind my left knee. After the ct my GP said it was due to infection(no blood work done) and now she has said it is STILL infections and ""not to worry"". I dont understand how it could be a run of the mill infection as she has given me 13 antibiotics this year and I still have the first neck lymph!! I cant change doctor and she has refused bloods(I think she thinks I'm a hypochondriac!!). I have constant headaches(ie have not gone for even a day) for the last year and now am losing weight. Any of this sound familiar to anyone??? Any advice or input would be great

Is there any immunotherapy out there for people like me who are immunosuppressed?  I strive to take care of myself yet am sick or worn out all the time. No quality of life here. And, since nobody can clearly diagnose my lung disease I don't know what to think. Help!

                Both of my lymph nodes on my neck are slightly swollen. They are movable and a little tender. The glands are soft and not very hard. I also have a pain behind my jaw near my ear. I recently had my wisdom teeth taken out and the pain is close to wear the teeth were removed. Is this why my lymph nodes are swollen?

                Hello,

I am a 23 year old female with swollen glands... I have had swollen glands for about 3 years now. Occasionally some of them will decrease in swelling, but they will swell up again and the majority of the time are swollen. I had my tonsils out in July of 2009 because the Doctor thought I was having infections and that was the cause of the swollen glands... but they are still swollen. I have one under my left clavicle. I have a few above and under my sternoclidomastoid of my left and right sides of my neck. Occasionally my occipital glands will swell and be painful. Recently, the glands under my ear, next to my mastoid process are swollen and painful. I have no drainage in my ears. I went to a hematologist/oncologist who sent me for blood work and CT scans. I had mono in 2006, and sometimes it shows up in my blood work again and again; however, my blood work this time is all normal. My CT showed that I do have enlarged lymph nodes in my neck, but the hematologist/oncologist doesn't seem to think it is lymphoma. I am meeting with an ENT on Tuesday. I feel like I should get a biopsy, I just don't understand why I have swollen lymph nodes all the time and I'm only 23! I'm looking for advice, please help!

                Hi, I brough my daughter to the Dr yesterday because she has had some nosebleeds. Normally they seem to be triggered by swimming pools but she had one the other night just out of the blue.  The Dr asked if she had any rashes and I said no, i had not noticed any. So, she looked on her back and found what looked like a little speckled spot. That was the only place. I could tell she was concerned and she ordered bloodwork to find out if we should be worried about leukemia. She does not have any other symptoms. The Dr. called and said everything looked normal and that her platelet count was at 215k.  I looked it up on the web and see that the normal range is 150 to 400. I know if the Dr. says it's normal I probably shouldn't worry but I can't help it. She seems to be at the lower end of normal and for a young healthy person it seems like she should be at the higher  end. Should I be concerned at all?  Should I ask for follow up bloodwork in the future? This whole thing just came out of the blue. I only brought her in to the Dr. to see if they could cauterize her nose. Thanks.

                I've read swollen neck lymph nodes in children are a sign of infection etc. and if they aren't a cause of infection or sickness and don't go down after 3 months it could be dangerous?

My 8 yr old daughter fell and hit her head last night so I took her to the ER.  The dr felt her neck and commented and asked if she had been sick - not for over a month, he said to have her pcp check them again BUT if she were 25 he'd have her in the hospital right then - ugh just what I wanted to hear.

My father developed Lymphoma (can't remember what exactly) in his early 60's and passed away within the past couple of months at age 67.

The thing I worry with my daughter is; she's so small - really tall for her age but the weight of a 4 year old, but has a great appetite; so I'm thinking it's just a fluke thing and I don't have to worry...easier said than done for sure.

                I am a 35 year old male and have recently had a full blood test due to symptoms i have been experiencing. The results are worrying to me, of particular concern is the low hemoglobin and high lymphocytes. Also noted by a hemotologist who studied my results was the comments that my blood film showed some smear cells and clefted lymphocytes suggestive of an early lymphoproliferative disorder.

BLOOD RESULTS
Haemoglobin: 129 g/L
WBC: 8.4 x 10(9)/L
Lymphocytes: 5.5 x 10(9)/L
Neut Seg: 2.2 x 10(9)/L
Monocyte: 0.6 x 10(9)/L
Eosinophil: 0.1 x 10(9)/L
Basophil: <0.1 x 10(9)/L
Platelets: 171 x 10(9)/L

CEA: 1.0 ng/mL

Symptoms I was experiencing:
Tingling and numbness in hands and fingers (no longer have this)
Headaches (every day for 2 weeks but less frequent now)
Dry mouth/thirst
Aching feet and legs
Some days feel very fatigued
Increasing weakness
Weight loss (3kg in 1 month)

My question is: can stress cause these symptoms along with these kind of blood results ? Is there something else this can be other than leukemia ?

I hope someone out there can help, thanks.

                Hello,  I am a 25 year old female with a lump in my right groin.  It grew very suddenly about a month ago and has slowlybeen getting harder and larger.  One doctor says it is a hernia and wants me to get an ultrasound. Another doctor thinks it might be a swollen lymph node, and that it may be related to an STD.  He 'cured' the STD on the spot and I'm currently waiting for test results back from that.  I just don't think it's a possibility since I've been with the same VERY LOYAL partner since February.  Plus, after the shot he gave me, the lump got HARDER...

Before you decide, I did have an inguinal hernia surgery there about 6 years ago.  It was during the mesh recall... So the first doctor thinks this may be a kinked re-herniation.  I think I would be hurting a lot more, right now it only hurts to stand up straight.

Please, what do you think? I am desperate and nervous. And in pain, I forgot to mention that.

In october i noticed a lump in the left side of my neck and when i went to the doctor she said she noticed another swollen node on same side and that my tonsils were a tad swollen and red, she said that they can swell after an infection has gone away. Got blood tests done and said everything waas fine and that swollen nodes less than an inch and dont hurt are nothing to worry about, but a few days ago i THINK ive found a swollen lymph node on the right hand side of my groin(no tenderness and rubbery, maybe from constantly touching it so i may have aggravated it). SWhould i get a second opinion? I mean i trust the doctors ive had but im a bit of a hypocondriac.

                Hello! I am a 30 year old female.  Havent had any bad health issues,  I  have been having pinching pains in my lympnodes since the middle of october.   Mostly in my head (by my ears)neck, shoulders, collarbone area, and elbows.    My lymph nodes are tender to touch.    I had some pain in my neck, so I felt around and found that I had a hard lymphnode on both sides of my neck in the towards the front.  I went to the regular dr, they did blood tests(ebv test negative), all came out good, and a chest xray, which was clear.  They gave me antibiotics saying that I had a small infection but  (zpack) that did not work.  They then prescribed me with doxycycline which didnt work either.  They sent me to an ENT.  The ENT said he wasnt concerned since the lymphnode was small but since it was bothering me, he sent me for an ultrasound.  The  Ultrasound examination demonstrates a left jugulodigastric node which measures 12 x 7 x 4 mm.   (the right one was a 10mm) so they did a fine needle aspiration of the left one.  It came back with no bad cells and said that it only found macrophages and lymphocytes.   The ENT put me on prednisone for 5 days and biaxin for 10 days.  I started to feel better but now that I am off the prednisone, I am starting to feel the pains again.  I dont have the sick, tired feeling anymore, just the pains are coming back.   I just finished the last dose of antibiotics.   
I haven't drank much alcohol but since I have been sick, when I do have a drink, pains hurt more the next day.   
 
Any ideas??
It sux being sick and no one can help!

                I am a 27 year old female. While pregnant with my first child I was diagnosed with thrombocytopenia. I was told it would go away after I was not pregnant which it never did. With no health insurance I skipped a scheduled bone marrow biopsy after my platelet counts continuously stayed under 75,000. I am terrified of needles which I know is silly. Recently I have noticed a lot of excess bruising (very large painful unexplained bruises), I have been extremely tired, and just got over a swollen lymph node in my neck. I am constantly sick with a cold or pneumonia. I lost a grandmother from my father's side to lukemia a few years ago and am kinda worried. But do not have insurance and don't want to seem like a hypochondriac to a doctor. Can anyone give me some advice or share their experiences with these diseases with me. It will be much appreciated.

user_851098,Lightningspring,/posts/Leukemia-and-Lymphoma-/1-cm-mass-in-neck-muscle/show/866088,1 cm mass in neck muscle,"
                Hello.  About 6 months ago I noticed a small lump, about 1 cm in diameter, around where the submandibular lymph nodes are supposed to be, just under my jaw line, halfway between my chin and ear on the left side.  It is firm, smooth, non-tender, and most interestingly, fixed into the muscle.  Note that it is not technically enlarged according to most standards I've read about.

I found something ""similar"" on the other side, so I did not think much of it, just watched it closely.  Last week, I decided that it would be worth a doctor visit.  The doctor examined it and found that I had to flex my neck muscles, the same action you do to push your lower jaw away from your face, in order to feel it at all (make it palpable).  Pushing on the area when the muscles are un-flexed reveals almost nothing, it feels like it is not there; when flexed, you can feel it easily and note that it does not move.  The doctor's conclusion was that it was a lymph node, but that since it is so small and that it has not grown since I first found it months ago, it really wasn't much to worry about.  None of the other lymph nodes were unusual, nor do I have any symptoms to suggest more sinister possibilities.

I was, in any case, displeased with the doctor's willingness to brush it off.  According to every article I have found on the internet, fixed lumps in the neck should always be given their due attention.  I plan on going to see a Ear / Nose / Throat specialist without referral (if I can find one to do such a thing), but in the meantime, after playing with it some more, I have a suspicion it may be something else.  I know the submandibular saliva gland's position is located very near where this little bump is, except inside the muscles, and I do not know if any part of it may protrude through the muscle, or perhaps a cyst has grown through the muscle (???).  Does anyone have any idea about the best course of action, given my description here?  I'd much appreciate it.

Earlier this year I had a CT scan to see if I had any lymph nodes up in my chest and abdomen which came back clear. More recently I was in hospital having IV antibiotics because of pseudomonas in my sinus and then I got septicaemia twice. Since coming out of hospital I have felt breathless and itching from head to toe which no-one can find out why I have it and I have also had a cold that I can not seem to shift. In the past three weeks my lymph nodes have been up, my temperature has been between 38-39 degrees,I have lost my appetite and now I have developed a cough. I saw my G.P yesterday and he got urgent bloods done which showed I had no infection. I do not know what to do and I will probably be going back to my G.P next week if no better. Does anyone think it is anything sinister.

                A few weeks ago my four year old son had small red spots appear on his ankle. Within a day, they appeared up his legs and on his arms, some of them as large as your fingertip. My son was also complaining of severe pain in his right leg and dragging it around for a few days. (I didn't find this alarming at the time because he is slightly knock kneed and has complained of pain in his legs before). After taking him to his pediatrician she diagnosed him with purpura and noticed his glands in his neck were extremely swollen. Ater all her findings she decided to run some blood work. His platelet count came back at 450 and his WBC at 10.6. His purpura dissapeared after about a week, and about 12 days later with his glands still significantly swollen his physician decided to rerun his blood work and add a few more tests. His platelets came back at 411, WBC 8.2, Lymphocyte 25%, Neutrophil 68% and Negative for CMV, EBV and Strep. Now, almost 5 weeks later and after a 10 day course of antibiotics his glands are still significantly swollen. Could he really have purpura with a platelet count of 450, or could this be a misdiagnosis on my physicians part? Is there anything else I should be concerned about? Could this still be leukemia?

                Is chronic high MCV worrisome/does it need further investigation? Last year they tested B12 and it was 228 so they thought that was the problem, supplements for 1 yr and B12 now exceeds threshold, but MCV still high. Looking back through records it has been high every cbc over past 10 years some during pregnancy some not.

                Hi,
My 4 year old daughter has ALL. She is currently on maintainence and was diagnosed July last year. She is going pretty well. The main problem has been that she is in the small percentage of people with a low enzyme count. Its called TPMT or something like that.... i think. She only copes with a 25% dose of a normal childs 50% dose and actually not even coping with this right now as her counts are currently very low. She is being treated at RCH and although the Doctors are good they really dont give much away. They say it does not mean her treatment will not be as effective but i know all the starting and stopping of the 6MP is not good which is what is happening. I cant find much info on this low enzyme thing. Should i be concerned? Also very strangely her temp has been very low lately over the last month or 2. Sometimes she feel hot and so i take her temp but it is 35.3-35.9 in most cases. Very strange as i have never seen this before. She has always been on the warmer side. Can this low temp be something to be concerned about? Thank you, Elly

                Well, over the past two months I have had some weird things happen, here they are. By the way, I'm just a High school student. 

-- The Feeling of Cold Hands (the rest of my body feels warmer)
-- Feeling Feverish, but never, not once, running a temperature. 
-- Some Lower Abdominal Pain (usually at night)
-- Odd Bowel Movements (looking different than usual) 
-- Constant urge to pass a BM

When I went to my doctor, they gave me a pro-biotic to help the bowel situation, but it has not worked. I'm not sure if the bowel is causing the first two symptoms, but I really don't need Luekemia.  


Help, please. I don't know what to do.

Now, tehre are enlarged lymphs, ( 1.6 cm ) in mesentary, with a laproscopic biopsy being done in a few days. Am I most likely looking at a lymphoma recurrence? Can Hodgkins come back as NHL?

                I have a very dry patch in my scalp on my left side. That i itch constantly .I noticed when rubbing my neck I have a movable painless lump- possible swollen lymph node- I don't think any other nodes are swollen but I can't tell. You can not see the lump- however when I tilt my head to my right side - you can see a tiny bump.

I am not faituged .... I am losing weigh but it's my pregnancy weigh since I had a child 3 months ago - I still have an appaitite and eat well- I get hot at night and sometimes sweat not soaking at all  but it can be from just giving birth and hormones...

Could this be a sign of cancer.?

                My 72 year old mother (who lives 3000 miles away!) has just told me she has a 'ball the size of a small walnut' under her jaw bone and that she went to the doctor to see if it was something 'bad'.... the doctor sent her for some tests (PET scan, blood work and biopsy) they really didn't find anything 'wrong' on blood and PET. The biopsy results are yet to come (it's killing us) and she says she is not that nervous since she is not presenting any kind of symptoms other than the swollen lymph node which feels soft (not hard) nor fixed. She also says that she's had this for years and years (at least 10) and just couple months ago she noticed it grow a little bit.
I just wanna know if there's a possibility this could be lymphoma or something dangerous like that.... =( my mom means everything to me, but I wanna be the most prepared possible for any kind of news, and be there for her.... plus figure out what to do if this is something horrible.....

I'm so depressed.

                I have been trying to educate myself on this disease. I looked up symptoms for lymphoma and I seem to have none of them listed except for the fact that i have a small lump behind my neck. Its not a hard lump, doesnt hurt, theres no ""ball like"" feeling either. I guess best way to describe the feeling of it would be the feeling of a fatty tumor. But its on the left side of the back of my neck, and from time to time i feel my neck tilting to the left side, (a problem i had corrected when i was real young.) This lump is also right underneath my hair line, i have a low hair line in the back so from the back of me it almost looks like i have no neck. So i guess my question would be, is the only lumps that would be felt that could possibly be lymphoma would be hard lumps? And from different diagrams i have found on different websites they show swollen lymph nodes being in the front of the neck, is this the case? Also i have read lymphoma has something to do with the immune system, and thank god all my life i almost never get sick. Im 21 and have probably been sick 8 times my whole life. So if i had a bad immune system would that also be a sign of lymphoma or does that not matter? I also recently had a doctors visit and also had routine blood work done before hand and all blood test came back fine. I forgot to mention this concern to him while i was there and only thought about it afterwards! I hope to get some advice and information direct from someone who knows about this disease rather than reading a million different things from different websites and giving myself anxiety. Thanks to anyone who can help!!

I was recently hospitalized for a bowel obstruction at 23 y/o. i have had this problem for years, a GI history like no other, with no diagnosis. Also, on/off urinary incontinence and rectal bleeding when i used to be able to run, n/v, chronic periorbital headaches, chronic joint pain, neck/back pain, severe, paresthesias in my extremities, sweaty red palms, swollen lymph nodes in armpits and groin, recently diagnosised with MRSA again, under my skin-no lesion found-they said they thought it was in a gland...oh, im bedbound now. complete exhaustion. my mother and best friend think i am crazy as they have not seen me, i moved 6 months ago when this all started-i got a case of tonsilitis-my first case-that would not go away and just never recooperated. im a rrecovery anorexix/bulimic, previously all my problems were blamed on that and everyone promised i would feel better if i gained weight, but i knew i would feel worse, and i do. horrible sweating, night sweats, hot flashes. i can no longer leave the house and my phone died. i went the the ER yesterday and begged for help but the doctor said to wait to see my primary. I have a positive ANA-autoimmune test. H/O lupus in family... grandmother died at 50 from pneumonia?! I was thinking Multiple sclerosis with myleopathy in the cervical area, as i have an inverted c-spine. but i find it odd that my friend from my eating disorder treatment, with my same story, just died from lymphoma. i dont know what to do. if someone can give me a diagnosis, at least i can tell my family/friend so they beleive im not psychotic. I am just an RN they say, the doctors know best...of i have had a clonus since i was bulimic-they told me it would go away. but it hasnt. currently i give myself enemas every 3 days, i urinate once daily, i sweat constantly or am freezing, tremors, twithing, my right leg fell asleep for a long time for no reason, severe neck paion speading down my arms and shoulder blades-i sleep on the floor if at all, severe low back pain severee knee pain-my joints feel frozen-icy hot all over my body is the only thing that works anymore...I swear I HAVE TRIED EVERYTHING, please can someone help?

by Vmp, Nov 18, 2010 08:02AM
Hi! 
I am 26 yr old female - in pretty good health. I just had my first child in august. 

I have had very dry itchy scalp my whole life. It never really seemed to bother me- when I got pregnant the dryness and itchyness seemed to be dormant. 

However after I gave birth the dryness came back in full force. It is on the back of my scalp on the left side near my hairline - starting from the bottoms of my hair line to above my ear- all in my scalp. 

I tried to look at the area if dryness and it's red with a white crust. Very itchy and burns at times. 

The other day I was rubbing my neck and I felt a lump on the left side of my neck. The lump is movable and is not tender to the touch. It feels rubbery. 

Now I google this and know I think I have cancer or tb. Then I think I make myself jaw other symptoms- i get very hot at night- I sweat but it's not a soaking sweat. 

Other than that - I don't feel tired  I don't have a fever, and the weight I am losing is from my pregnancy- I still have an appetiate. I workout every day and I feel fine. 

So any ideas why my lymph node is swollen?? 

I am not a fan of doctors ans I do have my yearly appointment the first week of January...

                Everyone  who have similar symptoms should take it very seriously. In 99% it is connected to cancer Hodgkin's Limphoma. My wife has it now, she had been had the same reactions to alcohol for 3 years. Please take it seriously, it is cancer!!!! so go to good doctor, not moron.

                Quick medical hx: I've been getting sick very often over the past year, but about 4 weeks ago had a bad cold that turned into a bacterial sinus infection and started to affect the lungs. Tried omnicef, and zpack, didn't work. Finally I'm on levaquin (5 days) and am finally starting to feel better, atleast my congestion is going away.My posterior lymph nodes were huge while I was sick, have gone down a little since, but over the past few days my axillary lymph nodes started to hurt, became enlarged, and so I checked my inguinal lyph nodes and they too are swollen, some are definitely large. (I don't feel like busting out the measuring tape) As a nursing student, I have examined my lymph nodes in the past for practice and could never palpate any. This is all new, I have been having severe night sweats on and off for a couple of months which I payed no attention to. I'm fatigued, and my muscles are sore, but other symptoms. My doctor is sick of seeing me, she's not the best anyway, and I'm pressed for time. Do I need to go back to the doctor? Or can I wait say 6 weeks and see if it goes away? Thanks.

I need to mention that I have lost 40 lbs since March, have gotten to were I have headaches all the time, more tired than normal, sweat alot easier than a person should, and even though i excerise regularly it has been easy to get winded. Just had a chest xray for an upper gi and it was normal though.  Oh and lets not forget that about the time i noticed the node I started having severe heartburn and that is something that i NEVER have.  I also noticed a petechiae rash on my chest today.

                i have had a ""hard"" lymph node on my neck, i believe in the submandibular region, for over a year. it is off to the right just slightly above where you adams apple is. my original primary doc said it was maybe cartilage and i left it for that and have lived with it since then, although it has contined to weigh on my mind. also, when i move over it or push on it, it can result in a ""grizzly"" sensation and sometime makes my ear feel plugged. last week i went in for a cold to my new doc and she felt the ""lump,"" and felt it was a lymph node, not cartilage. she refered me to an ENT, who also felt the lump. she said it could be the hyoid bone a bit out of place, a reactive node, or an indication of maglinancy (small chance however), she order an ultra-sound and FNA if it is not the hyoid bone. i began ""investigating"" other palpable nodes and noticed in my inguinal region i also have some small hardened nodes, they seem to be fixed, not moveable, but not rock hard either, and the skin moves easily over them, i believe have also felt these ones before. they are smaller than the one on my neck which is fairly small also. the one on my neck is deeper than the nodes felt right under your jaw line that often get swollen with a cold or flu. it is difficult to determine what is normal or not when feeling lymph nodes. i can't feel my other nodes, only these hardened ones and the larger ones right under your jaw line (which feel like they are ""suppose"" to according to the descriptions of how lymph nodes should feel. i might add they, too, seem a little swollen, but could be from the cold i recently had, or a number of other things.

additionally, about a year ago, as well, i was given an MRI for cysts on my ovaries. within the MRI findings was: ""there are small scattered subcentimeter mesenteric and retroperitoneal lymph nodes,"" what does that mean? that they are enlarged, yet smaller than 1 centimeter, or just that they were present, seen and then noted by the radiologist? additionlly, in the ""impression"" section, the radiologist noted that i have ""multiple hypodense lesions in the spleen, likely cysts. the spleen is of normal size."" in relation to that, i do often get a stabbing pain right under my rib cage on my left side, which, i assumed was gas, but it is frequent and always in the same place. the problem is whenever i investigate these findings online, lymphoma keeps popping up. i am wondering one, if several ""shotty"" nodes is normal, or if slightly hardened nodes in the said regions is normal, and, two, if the findings on the MRI are normal. i didn't question the MRI findings at the time although it did seem odd to me, because i assumed it would be mentioned to me if it was not normal. nor did i pursue the hardened node because my doctor dismissed it and i didn't want to be a ""worry wart,"" plus i have felt nervous that something could be wrong. as far as my cysts on my ovaries i have been being treated for that and consistant pain in my lower back and swelling of my lower abdominal region of which we have found no reason for (my obgyn), can all these thing be linked to together? or truly be signs of lymphoma. i'd rather start preparing mentally for a possible difficult diagnosis, or let it go and relax if i am just forcing puzzle pieces together at this point. : )

i know i have to ""wait"" for my ultra-sound and FNA for conclusive results; however, i would appreciate any information regarding the questions i have asked. thank you so much!

                Dear All, 

My two year old nephew has LLA Calla, he was first diagnosed on March 6th, 2009, with an excellent response to the treatment he achieved complete remission on April 14th, 2009.  On April 23, 2010 he was diagnosed again, he recovered again on June 1st, 2010.  Once again on September 22nd, 2010 he was diagnosed again and it's now in the process of treatment.

Since April 2010 when he was encountered with the desease again, it was proposed for him to have Hemopoyetic Transplant, but he does not have a compatible donor.  For this reason, it is proposed to have a non-related transplant when he achieves remission again.

My nephew is currently in Venezuela where he receives the treatment and is fighting to achieve remission again, but we dont have the resources to pay for his transplant in the USA, so right now we are at a crossroads, we dont know what is going to happen after remission if we can not afford his transplant, he may fall again and again.  My question is, how can we get help..?, is there any organization that can help children and families from outside the USA, we can certainly pay for the trip to the US for him and his mom, but we can not afford the medical bill.  Can anyone give me some advises.  I do nothing but to search the internet these days looking for help.

Your advises and your prayers will be most appreciated.

                I just got some blood work results back. Sorry I do not have reference ranges or complete details right now, so I'm not sure if this is of any help at all. Can you help me figure out if this means anything>

CBC:
White Blood Cell Count: 13.4 (high)
MCV: Low
MCH: Low
Granulocytes: 1.0 

I've had a low grade fever and some pain near a hard lymph node. A CT scan was clear and didn't show anything. I've had eosinophil issues in the past. 

The doctor is repeating the test in a bit. Do these results indicate anything?

Thanks!

                I have been to the doctors today as I have been showing symptoms of hodgkins lymphoma but the doctor dismissed the idea before even hearing about my symptoms and what I had to say, but he did agree to give me a blood test as i was so worried.  he assured me that if i did have the disease that the blood test would show this 100% but after reading up on the internet I am not so sure, he didnt really seem to know alot about the disease if the blood test comes back normal, is that 100% certainty that i do not have hodgkins lymphoma?

He told me he would probable be able to get the results back to me the same day which seems fairly quick to me?

                Hello! I'm hoping someone has some ideas for me. I have been dealing with my issues for nearly 2 years and don't have any answers. I was doing some research yesterday and today and was wondering if this may be lymphoma. I had mono in the past and also have eosinophilc bronchitis. I have read that there is a correlation with these and lymphoma. I am going back to my primary care physician next week, so I'd love some ideas for what might be going on with me and additional tests to request. Any help/ideas/suggestions are greatly appreciated.

Symptoms:

--Pain in front part of throat near thyroid. I have a palpable, hard lump in the front of my throat about halfway down. It feels almost like I'm being strangled. The pain can be so bad I want to cry myself to sleep. I've had 2 endocrinologists confirm it is not thyroid-related pain even though it's near the thyroid. The pain seems to mostly radiate from the area where I feel the palpable lump. An ultrasound showed the lump I feel is a lymph node. The doctor was dismissive and said the lymph node was not large and was not causing the problem. The lump (lymph node) itself doesn't hurt when I touch it, but the pain radiates from around that area. How could this not be causing the pain somehow?

--Swollen lymph node under my jaw.This is on the same side of my throat as the lymph node near my thyroid. The lymph node is probably about 1.5 inches diameter. It doesn't hurt, and is hard to the touch.

--""Numbness"" in my chin and lips when the pain in my throat is bad. I used quotes because my chin and lips do not really go numb, they just have that sensation (like after you get a Novocaine shot).

--Night sweats. Not to the point where my sheets are soaking wet, but I am sweaty and my hair is wet when I wake up.

--I am always cold.

--Constant low-grade fever (99-99.5). 

--Tire easily.

Thanks for your help!

                Ive got a squishy moveable lump in the right side of my neck, cervical area, doesnt hurt.

Ive got tender ones under my chin but cannot feel lumps, its just tender in that area.

Ive got three on the right side of my groin, dont hurt, little bit moveable, quite firm, had ultrasound on these and it just showed enlarged lymph nodes. 

Bloods are normal, although not sure what bloods they did?? (it was in a&e department and hospital overnight) I know that one of them was a LDH blood tests specifically for lymphoma, but because this and all my other bloods were ok, they sent me home.

Now im told if they get bigger to come back. They arent getting bigger but they are getting a bit firmer and im getting more nodes that i can feel on left side of groin and one under armpit (but not really that feelable as its right deep down).

Please help. I dont know if this is lymphoma. My doctor doesnt want to biopsy coz he doesnt think its lymphoma as my bloods are normal!? But are bloods accurate?? I really am finding it hard to accept :(

                Hi, I have seen many posts with similar questions but I am very stressed out over my inability to get an appointment with a physician in my city for the next couple of weeks, so decided to ask. I am 23 years old, without any previous health conditions in my history. I noticed a swollen inguinal lymph node on the left side three days ago. At the time, it was not tender at all and probably < 1cm. Since then, I have been palpating it a lot and now it is a bit tender (only when touching it) and seems to be a little bigger. This is the only enlarged lymph node in the body and I feel like I could possibly have a cold right now,although the symptoms are fairly mild and no fever. The node is fairly hard and not squishy at all. What could this be? Should I go to the ER?
Thank you

                I just got released from a very long hospital stay yesterday. It's been very trying going through this last two weeks. I got the wonderfull bacterial pneumonia and was admitted to my little hospital in Fairview. Low o2 sats, lungs full, fever the whole 9. No fun. After 3 days of IV Rocephin antibiotics and oral Z pack my WBC count was still rising. It was not to high around 13 at that point so doc switched me to IV Zoscyn and added oral Levaquin. My lungs cleared up and sputum samples came back negetive but after 4 more days my WBC count went to 17.1. So my GP sent me to OU hospital in the city. They have no clue on what is making my WBC count so high. I had two teams of doctors looking after me there and no real answers. I no longer have a fever but the fatigue is almost unbearable. The only other symptoms i have is recurring HA and the slightest bone aches. One of the teams had an Endo as the head doc and she suggusted that the steriod use could be the cause? I know that it can elevate WBC count a little but I've only been on the florinef 0.1mg for 3 weeks and for it to keep climbing that high seems unlikely to me. They have also suggusted leukemia or a lymphomia but have done no testing for either one. I got released on very strick instructions that if I had any fever or any new symptoms that I must call 911 and immediatly return to them and I have to stay close by so if one of the blood work tests come back with anything that I can return promptly. Waiting on MRSA and C diff and blood cultures. I'm sure its not C diff and MRSA seems unlikely. Also the other hospital did blood cultures and came up with no growth. They checked for endocardiitus also and was neg. So after that long story I guess I'm wondering does anyone have expierence with elevated WBC count in association with corticosteriod use and if so was or can it be that high from less than a month of taking it? Or should I be seeking a hemotolgist/ oncologist? Also want to mention that RBC showed anemia. I have POTS and adrenal insuffiency also. Getting very worried.

                I have had lymph nodes on my head, neck, and armpits for about a year (at least, that's when I first noticed them). They tend to change in size -- sometimes, my armpits feel uncomfortable when my arms are down (I assume they are tender). I first went to my family physician and she told me that they could be caused by my acne and cysts that I have in both earlobes. About a month or two after that, I decided to go to the dermatologist about this. So I went to the dermatologist and she looked at the lymph nodes on my neck (and I showed her some lumps on my lower back, which are fatty -- she told me those felt like little lipomas -- they were grouped together and you can move them around). She told me they could be caused by my acne, the cysts, or any sinus problems I have (I sneeze a lot, etc). So I went home and I felt fine, but then I started to worry again. So then I made another appointment with my doctor, who felt them and asked if they had grown any (answer was 'not to my knowledge'). She felt my body for more (I have one that pops up a little below the belt line every once in a while, but I'm not sure if that is part of my groin or abdomen, its really small, no matter, because when I can feel it, it's barely there). She had a blood test done to check for cancers and such and it came back negative. But then I kept reading and found out that Lymphoma wouldn't necessarily show up on a blood test. So THEN I made an appointment with an ear nose and throat doctor. The first appointment with him, it was actually one of his helpers (he was out that day and needed another doctor to fill in). That doctor felt of the lymph nodes on my neck and told me that he didn't know if he could even get a needle in for an FNA because they were so small (I guess maybe they're big to me because I am not a doctor). He then prescribed me an antibiotic. When I took them, my lymph nodes seemed to shrink a tad (I didn't exactly take the medicine on time every day). So then I went back again three weeks later and it was the actual doctor that worked there. I spoke with him for a few minutes and he told me that all the lymph nodes he felt were extremely small, and laughed about my being so paranoid about them. :P

So anyway, a few weeks ago I fell and bruised my foot. I went to the ER and of course before I left I asked him about them. And he told me they didn't look like anything to be worried about. 

In all, I've spoken to 5 doctors on about 10 visits and they all say there's nothing to worry about. What do you think?

                Okay I do not believe I have Leukemia, but every time I look up this symptom I find Leukemia. I am hoping to get the bottom of my problems and would like to ensure that bone pain is the best description for what is occurring to me. I have two types of pain that seems to come from my bones or at the very least very deep in the muscle. One is a aching that leaves my legs feeling extremely cold. To the point of me laying in very hot water to try and get some warmth. My legs will turn red from the heat and warm enough that I can at least tolerate the chill. And then on occasions I experience a very fast radiating pain that feels as though a knife is pushed through the bone and moved in one direction or another. When this one happens I want to apply pressure for some reason. Not sure if it really helps get rid of the pain or not, because I always grab out of instinct. I guess I should mention the aching was only in my legs, but has started bothering my fingers also now and occurs on both side at the same time. The radiating pain can occur just about any where in my limbs. Hands, fore arms, upper arms, feet, shins, and thighs. When this happens it is in only one location at a time and my only happen once or several times over the course of ten minutes or so. If anyone has experienced anything similar to these and has any clue what it could be please let me know. Also if this does not sound like bone pain, please let me know what you think it may be. Thanks in advance.

Hi,

On the 30th of December I noticed a hard 'lump' in the groove of my collarbone. It was hard, immobile and I didn't really pay any attention to it. On the 3rd of January I got a cold, mainly sneezing my head off and headaches and around the 10th I became well again. However I noticed that the 'lump' got bigger and then around the 14th I noticed that next to it something rubbery and mobile appeared. On the 17th I went to the doctor cause I started getting pain from the rubbery lymph nodes and also pain in my chest. The doctor did an ultrasound scan on which the three lymph nodes appeared as black blotches and the hard one was 3mm larger then it should be. He checked the other lymph nodes and found five of them to be tender to the touch and then diagnosed me with lymphadenitis without checking my blood. 

On Monday I got my blood results and I had normal leukocytes, low iron and 120 hemoglobin which made him worried. Only my sedimentation was slightly elevated, showing that there was a process going on. He gave me antibiotics and since I was on vacation told me that I should probably ask for a biopsy and a chest scan when I returned since I had chest pain and the doc didn't know why my lymph nodes were enlarged.

I have finished with the antibiotics and the chest pain is gone, but I still have some discomfort in the rubbery nodes. My own doctor told me that he could put me through all the scans I want, but first I have to wait it out since he believes it's an infection and it should subside in 6 weeks. They did another blood test, and this time everything was normal.

I trust my doctor, however I have been experiencing night sweats (nothing too much, just wake up with damp hair), have been having headaches since the 17th non stop and now I'm going crazy because my entire body is itching, keeping me awake especially my face, head, arms and legs. 

Is this just lymphadenitis or might it be something else? Also that hard lymph node has been there for a month now and it's not getting smaller. Any help?

Thanks for your time and patience to read this.

                Hi All, 

My mum had a bone marrow transplant some 22 months ago and is progressing very well. The one thing that is strange and no one can seem to give us an answer is that it seems if she eats chicken or duck after about 15 mins she is very sick and brings up any food or liquids for the next hour? We thought at first it was food but over time we got it down to just poultry? Has anyone else had this type of issue and if so will it ever be OK to eat this type of meat again?

Thanks

                Hi, i'm a healthy 29 year old male, 6'1 165-70lbs..so i'm on the thin side.

I've had a palpable ~2cm lymph node on my right axilla when i first noticed it about 4 years ago. For some anxiety reason, i'm only now started to worry about it (i've had a history of panic attacks). It's soft and movable. Painless. My latest CBC is normal..but never got an LDH or ESR. Last HIV test was negative as well. No weight loss, fevers, itching. However i'm started to notice some soreness in the axilla (can't tell if its real or mental). 

It is worth getting it checked out at this point?

my 5 year old has been poorly for a year constant infections, night sweats, bed wetting, fatigue, paleness, occasional rashes even behaviour issues, runny clear fluid out of nose, emotionalness, continous lymph swellings. in sept and oct 2009 she had 2 swellings on her groins behind her lymph nodes they were removed and fluid drained the node was tested and i was never told any issues. She now for the past 6 months has had constant swellings in her neck all down her neck with the right being more then the left im told.  shes down for a tonsil removal 1st week in dec coming as they want to rule out them causing the further lymph swellings.

She has had her blood results back today and im extremley worried

Platelets should be up to 4.00 and they are 4.33.

                So, I am on a quest to try to figure something out.

I've got these lumps on the left side of my ribs right where the bone and cartilage come together.  Started out with one rib, now I've got bumps on three ribs at and just above my brest.  I'm a healthy 30 year old mother of two small children.  I have had a chest x-ray to figure out what the bumps are, and it showed nothing.  I've had a CT scan to see what it is and that showed nothing unusual.  My general doctor has now referred me to a cardio throacic surgeon to try to figure out why there's a bump you can see but that doesn't show up on the x-ray or CT scan.  He threw out the word lyphoma as a possiblity.  Does that sound like an option to anyone out there?  It's confusing the heck out of me.

I also am exhausted all the time, and have been bruising more than normal and have wierd aches and pains that are not normal, like I have ring-worm on my arm that won't go away and the slightest knick witll bleed for half a day. but that could be due to my kids. 

Any ideas?  I'm fishing for anything now!

                Hi, 
Don't know where to turn anymore. I will try to make this short...I am 27 years old, have lots of cancer in the family, my mother was diagnosed with Hodgkin's when she was 27, and the whole line of her family died from leukemia and other cancers.
Lymph nodes in my neck swelled up in April, so bad I couldn't swallow. Blood work showed high sedimentation rate, low neutrophils and high lymphocytes with everything else being normal. Ultrasound of my neck shows lymph node at 2.5cm size, thyroid is larger than normal. Doc sends me to have hormone levels checked. Blood work shows antiTG and antiTPO 350 and 150 times the normal amount. T3, T4, TSH levels are normal. I am diagnosed with Hashimoto's and told to check hormones every 6 months and come back when TSH level is more than 5 so they can put me on meds. I am put on amoxicilin for the lymph nodes. 3 weeks go by and I am still sick, still sore, neck is swollen. I go back to the doc and again I'm told it's just a cold/flu and am given cipro this time. A month later I am put on a third round of antibiotics. In July I finally feel a bit better, the lymph node decreased but was still present. My mom dies, I get a divorce, and am overcome by stress and worry. My health seems fine until August when I get ""sick"" again. Constant dry irritating cough, occasional runny nose, headaches on a daily basis, and overall fatigue. Since August these symptoms have grown worse and worse. In September I end up in the ER after spending literally close to two hours vomiting. I go to the ER completely dehydrated and barely standing on my feet. On the spot, bloodwork shows wbc 17,100. I'm kept in observation for an hour and put on IV with antibiotics. Two hours later my wbc drops to 16,400 and they send me home assuming it will continue to drop. Next morning, wbc drops to 7800 and they tell me to see a gastro doctor. Next few days I feel weak and lightheaded. Week later I get horrible diarrhea lasting almost 3 days. At this point I've lost about 6 pounds since the first week of September. I get my blood checked for the Hashimoto's a few days later and again my neutrophil count is low, lymphocyte count is high and yet my hormone levels have dropped significantly. I see a hematologist that night who feels my neck and says my lymph node is about 1.5cm, after physical exam he notes my liver is enlarged and diagnoses me with neutropenia. Liver function tests come back normal, EBV neg, MCHC is lower than normal, HCV neg, urine normal, everything comes back fine except the MCHC which is low. Blood smear shows 41% seg, 1% eo, 1% bazo, 45% lympho, 5% atypical lymph, and 1% lymphoplamacit. Hematologist says nothing is too abnormal and tells me to take 100mg of vitamin B6, and 10mg of folic acid, and 2000mg of vitamin C every day for three weeks and then come to see him if I don't feel better at which point he suggests a node biopsy. Been on this vitamin therapy for 8 days now, feel worse than ever, have now lost a total of 14 pounds since late August due to absolutely no appetite and nausea when I think of food, this morning I woke up with a swollen neck and this lymph node is now HUGE. I can't swallow, just like when you have tonsilitis only I had mine removed 6 years ago. I'm dizzy, tired, have no strength at all, and every couple of days I get a terrible pain in my back right in the spine which doesn't go away for hours. I have constant nausea which is increased when I'm in a bus or car or a stuffy room, it gets so bad that I feel like I'm going to throw up and then faint and it doesn't get better until I lie down for an hour or manage to fall asleep.
I have a constant low-grade temperature of 99-99.5 degrees which will suddenly go up and my face will flush, then it drops, usually occurs in the middle of the day. 
Anyone experience these symptoms? I don't have any real lymphoma symptoms, but being ""sick"" for over two months is now killing me. My symptoms are now chronic and I can't seem to get answers. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

My husband had a allogeneic (Donor - related) bone marrow transplant in July 2007. He seems to Finally be on the road to recovery after a whole list of complications including mild GVHD (Graph Verses Host Disease). We have only been married for 3 years and we have a son (14 months). Before the treatment started his dr suggested we store some sperm because of the risk of sterility... we did. The thing is I'd really like to exhaust all other options to try to concieve a baby naturally. Does anyone out there have any advise regarding this??

Any help would really be great!

                Hi,

I'm a 24-year-old male, (6 foot 2/163 lbs) I'm healthy I workout from 2-3 hours 5 x a week. For the most part I'm extremely health conscience with the foods I eat and pick and am ""partial vegetarian"" as my friends would call it (I eat fish and Chicken). I'm not perfect. Sometimes at night to do go on wild binges that typically occur if I can't sleep at around midnight. Generally, I will have 3-4 bowls of cereal with 2 cups of 2% milk. Not good seeing as how I'm lactose intolerant. This can also be factored my inhibitions are non existent around this time because I do smoke Marijuana at night to relieve my anxiety, but like I said, these ""binges"" only happen 1-2/week so weight wise not concern and it's healthy cereal Whole Grain stuff (just a lot of calories that's for sure!). I am a light smoker, as well, and take supplements for weight loss (the caffeine based ones, Protein Shakes, low amounts of Creation, Multi Vitimans, Vitiman b-12 have been for 2 years now). I think the fat burning pills I've been taking for a year and a half are caffeine based. Finally, I suffer from chronic anxiety (have since I was 4) as well as brutal insomnia. Insomnia is something I have suffered from as a child, too.

Anyway, I thought I'd give some medical history. I also had 2 seizures last year in relation to something called hydrocephalus (sp?). The Neurologist said I was fine and there was no need for medication or concern saying a return of seizures if highly unlikely this was confirmed by the Neurosurgeon that we saw and looked at my MRI and a EEG test done 1.5 months after Seizures and Cat Scan. I was taking Lorazopam, Xanax and Halcion at that time and it's believed the abrupt discontinuation of the Xanax and drinking diet redbull like water and lack of sleep and abuse of fat burners is what caused all this. As the Neurologist put it ""a perfect storm"". Oh, and the 6 hour workouts. **Happy to note I no longer take Xanax or drink Red Bull since then. 

In August I caught a cold. I was pretty sick for a few days but nothing out of the normal from when I catch a cold. Stayed in bed and the cold itself went away within a week. Of course the allergies persisted because I have seasonal allergies. However, around (Aug 19th?) I began to notice a very tender pain on the right side of my neck and upper shoulder. This could be because I carry a lot of weight on this shoulder. However, the pain got worse and then I noticed in the first week of September a swollen gland. I showed my parents and they seemed to think nothing of it (but they never do, not even when I got Steven Johnson syndrome (it wasn't until I couldn't breath that my parents to me back to the hospital and this was diaginosed and took me off all the anti-epileptic meds), in addition the glands around the sides of my neck where slightly swollen as well. I had also not been feeling like myself. I had been feeling dizzy and getting headaches on one side of my head from time to time but nothing real bad. My parents wrote it off as allergies and I continue to workout, take my supplements and prescription meds, as well as smoking marijuana before bed. 

Then I got depressed. Very depressed with life in general (Late Aug/Sept). This might of been the worst I've had it. I read some self help books and managed to apply much of what is in there in my life and was able to get out of that dark hole.

Throughout September things got worse. My glads swelled up more, dizzy on and off, minor headaches. Finally in October I couldn't take it anymore the glands where not going down but getting worse and my breathing was starting to concern me. I went to a walk-in Dr. who wrote it up as Nasal allergies but I wasn't satisfied with that because he said glands 'just swell sometimes because it's early October and that's allergy season.' (I live in Toronto, Canada) 

That week I saw my family Dr. He inspected the swollen gland on the neck that is located just around the left side at hair line. He said it was under a certain CM that they use as a basis to see how to ***** how bad things are. He inspected my neck, arm pit area and said he believed I was fine but wanted to do blood work anyway. The following week things just got worse and worse. There where times where I was having trouble to breath and I was talking to my brother who suffers from asthma and he said kinda sounds like some kind of asthma attack. The glands under my jaw swelled up and fast and that was what seemed to contribute to my breathing problems. Then just above my Adams apple (last week) I noticed a cyst or something. It's the size of a pea maybe its very movable and feel kinda rubby. It's been there since (this one not painful). The glands have not gone down, in fact the ones under my jaw seem to be getting worse. The one at the back of my neck is still there and tender. I'm having major Anxiety attacks about this and my Birthday just passed and i did nothing because I was so scared I aggravate this. This cyst is not going down and seems to be progressing? am I crazy? Sometimes at night especial 7pm (?) I get cluster like head pain and experience breathing problems so I breath in and out real heavy on count of 7 and exhale and it seems to help. I have not changed anything from my daily life. 

Please..Can anyone shed some light on this for me? I haven't had dramatic weight loss or loss of energy. This is scaring me so much I can't sleep at night even and I have some big auditions coming up. 

Please anyone help me!

Medications currently on: Lorazopam 2mg X 2 Daily (believe me, I need it with this going on), Nitrazopam 10MG 1x bed time and over-the-counter ""fat buring pills"", Multi-Vitimas, B-12 supplement, Protien Shake w/2 g of Creatine. Workout 5 times/Week 2-3 hours, Work 9-5. 

I'm desperate for any kind of answer I've spent hours on end on the net look for something and it seems like Lymphoma, Lyme Disease, HIV, Throat Cancer, Thyroid, all come up or Allergies but heck isn't allergy season over? Oh and recovering from a bacterial infection!!?? that was in August lol Geez...It's interfering with my work because all I do is research this stuff.

                Hello all, this is my second try for help as im at a loss, below is a copy paste of my first question to which i had no response and im hoping someone can help and advise me. 

------------------------------------------------------
Hello all 

within the last 9 months my daughter has had several lypmh node issues first started off as groin, she had 2 large swellings and after 2 weeks fluid was drained from behind 2 lymph nodes each side they were left to heal inside to out without stitches.... they do not know why this happened. She was very poorly, pale, glassy eyed, continous clear fluid running from nose, always complaining of belly ache. Very emotional easily upset, very lathargic, sleepless nights, bed wetting.  Since having 3 operations 7-9 months ago ( they operated on the lymph nodes 3 times ) she has had same issues, as explained above less the groin swellings but now has lymph nodes swollen in her cervical (neck)  area each side with the right being more then the left.... from top to bottom.... she has no apparent throat infection however she has been treated with anti-biotics but still has the swellings, she was reffered to an ENT specialist who said he feels its not tonsilitus as she doesnt have the symptoms but is going to remove her tonsils and he feels they are chronically inflamed.... he said she could also have swollen lymph nodes in her tummy hence why she always complains of tummy ache.... im worried that this could be lymphoma as ive never seen a child have 4 operations on lymph nodes within a year she is only 5.   

Can someone give me advice about this, help me in what to do or say to the doctors, as i feel for my daughter whos ill every few days, whos always emotional, always pale, and now always wetting her bed at night. 

Thanks :( 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Since writing this she has had a terrible time going from thriving to poorly, pale emotional you name it everything has gone bad this week, she has once again a clear fluid running from her nose continous, she has started sleep walking and wet her bed 5 times last night dispite being lifted to the toilet at 1030-11pm.  We have had very bad temper yesterday she didnt know why she was acting the way she was. There is still no news of her tonsil op as yet. 
Her armpits looked swollen yesterday im not sure if this could be a lymph swelling?

I have a hx of breast cancer.  I have read that this uptake is not consistent with cancer, and my Dr. says it probably is not but because of my hx need to check with CT dx.  How will this test be different or show a difference than that of the PETSCAN?  Can they do a lung biopsy on a 8mm nodule.  She says it could be inflammation or an infection.

                8 year old son has swelling in the right side of neck.  Upon feeling lymph nodes it has been discovered they are larger and rock hard, non-movable.  Located right above the collar bone. Swelling from the throat to the back of the neck.  Pain around the node but not on the node itself.  Antibiotics for 1 wk have not helped (cefdinir 300 mg twice daily).  CT scan shows swelling of the tissue in the neck and son was referred to ENT specialist at Children's.  Low grade fever comes and goes, night sweats/cold sweats.  Restless during the day and night, sleeping meds to make him sleep at night. Has history of frequent illness including strep usually twice a year which usually causes swelling of nodes around the ear and bottom of jaw.  This time it is located in a different location (never noticed swelling there before) and glands are hard like rocks.  Won't know anymore until after we see the ENT specialist on Tuesday Sept 7 so just looking for info from anyone who might know what is causing this.  Everytime I do a search it comes up possible Lymphoma.

                I've been retaining water in my stomach, face, arms and legs lately. I've been flu-ish and lethargic but I thought that was nothing to worry about. I mentioned it all to my doctor and he said it was likely a food intolerance or IBS, both of which we eliminated. Recently I went to the ER for an unrelated matter and the doctor told me my lymph nodes in my neck and armpits are very swollen and I likely have Glandular Fever. My question is, would this account for my water retention or is it something else? My weight's been varying 10-15lb in a matter of days, it's very frustrating.

                Hello, I have had a growing lymph node in the back of my neck for several years.  I got used to it and ignored it.  My wife noticed about 4 months ago that it was quite large and it was actually visible with the naked eye as something that bulged from my neck (looked like a ping pong ball).  I went to a head and neck surgeon and he found several others in my neck that I was unaware of.  He did some blood tests, was not mononucleosis and my lymphocyte count was high.  He did a fine needle aspiration and it came back inconclusive, stating that there was an abundance of lymphocytes.  He ordered a CAT scan and this showed several enlarged lymph nodes.  Finally, he did remove the large node from my neck and sent it to a pathologist.  The official diagnosis was ""reactive hyperplasia"" and ""progressive transformation of germinal centers.""  I was instructed to return in 6 months for a follow up.

Since then (3 months ago), I have discovered a couple of other lymph nodes in my neck (probably showed up in the CT scan) but I can also feel them.  Some are less than 2cm, but some are larger than 2cm in diameter.  I also just found another one or two a couple of days ago over my right collar bone.  It/they are smaller than the ones in my neck, but something is definitely there.

Should I be satisfied with the PTGC diagnosis, or worried that something else is going on?  Should I speak to an oncologist?

                This past year I have been to the doctor many times for either sinus infection, ear infection, pneumonia, or asthma.  I never seem to get fully better and then I am sick again.  I have been put on multiple antibiotics which only seem to make things better for a time before the next infection hits.  I am chronically tired but stubborn enough to keep pushing through.  My most recent lab results showed a high WBC of 11.0,  low RDW of 10.7, low MPV of 5.2, high neutrophils of 83, high ANC of 9.1, low potassium of 3.2, low phosphorus of 2.2, low sodium of 131, and low chloride of 94.  Everything else seemed ok.  The hematologist is still waiting on some other tests to come back and is considering a bone marrow biopsy depending on results.  I just want to know why I am always sick.  Any thoughts are appreciated.

                Hi,

I had an ultrasound done on Aug 1st with the following description of the lymph nodes in my right armpit:

[COLOR=""Red""]Aug 1st
------------
Scans through the right and left axillae show multiple lymph nodes, five on the right side and six on the left side. These lymph nodes show fatty hilum. The largest lymph node in the right axilla is 2.4 x 0.6cm and in the left axilla 2.4 x 0.8cm.[/COLOR]

Yesterday I had an ultrasound done that came back with the following report:

[COLOR=""Red""]Sept 28
------------
The ultrasound shows clearly benign lymph nodes in the right axilla. The largest of these measures 2.8cm x 1.5cm x 0.9cm. It has a large fatty hilum. The lymph nodes appear to have a benign appearance. However, there cortical mantle is slightly thickened. The lymph nodes can be followed or biopsied if perferred, but a biopsy is not likely necessary based on the presence of fatty hilum.
[/COLOR]
Over the course of 2 months, the lymph node grew 3 times as wide and a 1/2 cm longer. I know the fatty hilum is still there, but can't an enlarged cortical mantle also be the start of mantle lymphoma? I'm not saying I have it, as I know the odds are slim, but I hate the wait and see approach since I did that and it has grown. Now the second ultrasound was done by a different lab, so they didn't know it grew 3 times as wide, so maybe if they did it would have changed his opinion on the biopsy. 

Do you guys/gals think I am overreacting to ask for a biopsy as I am quite worried. I originally went for the ultrasound because I felt a painless/movable lump getting bigger in my armpit and neck. I also have Celiac's Disease which can increase some lymphoma's and I'm fatigued a lot. Anyways, any help is appreciated.

Thanks!

                My beautiful, healthy, active, and popular 14 year old daughter started complaining of bone pain (mostly in her lower back, but also generalized), fatigue, and excessive bruising on her legs almost a year ago. I attributed these symptoms to her active lifestyle (she's athletic and in gymnastics and pep squad). In June of this year I began to notice that her bruises were not healing and were in strange places (under her toenails, and on her hands). In July she developed appendicitis and underwent an appendectomy. Her CBC at that time was normal. After her surgery, in August, she started high school and seemed to get sicker.....frequent sore throats, fevers, nausea. She lost several pounds and was sleeping excessively. I took her to the doctor and he ran a CBC and diagnosed her with mono. All of her platelet, white and red blood cell counts were normal. That was two months ago. The doc said mono was no big deal, and to expect her to get better in two to four weeks. Well, six weeks later she has only gotten worse. She's always fatigued, never has an appetite, has had to sit out of football games twice due to almost passing out on the field, gets nauseated and has diarrhea 2-4 times a week, and continues to complain of ""bone pain"". Her bruises on her toes from over two months ago have not healed. I've taken her back to the doctor twice, and last week her WBC was low...2400....but this week has resumed a normal 4000 count. My daughter actually had mono before, when she was nine, and the symptoms were so much different from this time around....that time she just had a fever and sore throat and was tired for a few weeks. She didn't bruise easily and complain of bone pain. I have been worried about the possibility of leukemia, but her blood counts have been pretty much normal. Is leukemia truly an impossibility? Should I stop worrying and just trust that this is mono, and that sometime soon she will start feeling OK and be able to enjoy being a healthy teenager again? These symptoms have been present for close to nine months now.

I am waiting on a hospital appointment to remove the lump, but am worried and would like further information as nothing was supplied to me. My son is 8yrs old.

                Hello, I have had a growing lymph node in the back of my neck for several years.  I got used to it and ignored it.  My wife noticed about 4 months ago that it was quite large and it was actually visible with the naked eye as something that bulged from my neck (looked like a ping pong ball).  I went to a head and neck surgeon and he found several others in my neck that I was unaware of.  He did some blood tests, was not mononucleosis and my lymphocyte count was high.  He did a fine needle aspiration and it came back inconclusive, stating that there was an abundance of lymphocytes.  He ordered a CAT scan and this showed several enlarged lymph nodes.  Finally, he did remove the large node from my neck and sent it to a pathologist.  The official diagnosis was ""reactive hyperplasia"" and ""progressive transformation of germinal centers.""  I was instructed to return in 6 months for a follow up.

Since then (3 months ago), I have discovered a couple of other lymph nodes in my neck (probably showed up in the CT scan) but I can also feel them.  Some are less than 2cm, but some are larger than 2cm in diameter.  I also just found another one or two a couple of days ago over my right collar bone.  It/they are smaller than the ones in my neck, but something is definitely there.

Should I be satisfied with the PTGC diagnosis, or worried that something else is going on?  Should I speak to an oncologist?

                I am a 40 year old,female married with 6 children. 
Last week I found a lump on the right side of my neck and then the next day I noticed another one which was bigger so I went to the doctors the following day which was the Tuesday.The doctor ordered a full blood examination along with some other blood tests and and I had to have an ultrasound done. 
I got the blood test done that day and the ultrasound the next day. 
On the Thursday afternoon I got a call from the doctors office asking me to come in as they had all my results and the doctor needed to see me,my liver,kidneys and thyroid were all fine but there was something else that the doctor needed to see me about. 
I saw the doctor the next day and she was concerned with something about my bloods and has referred me to a haemotologist. 
My full blood examination was essentially within normal limits. 
My MCH was slightly low at 26.5 pg and my MCHC was slightly low at 31.8 g/dL 
My ultrasound also showed there were 4 lymph nodes not 2. 
They are 10,6 and 6mm and 1 is 14x8x3mm palpable lymph node on the right posterior triangle. 
I also have had occasional night sweats,itchiness on arms,legs and neck,headaches,aching joints,fatigue,loss of appetite. 
Some of these symptoms could be because I do have 6 children. 

I have an appointment on the 7th October and am concerned. 
Is this normal procedure,should I be worried.Should I have been put on antibiotics first before being refered to a haemotologist. 
Does this mean there is something really wrong? 
Thanks for listening and I hope someone can shed some light on this for me.

                I'm wondering if anyone who has had a lymph node biopsy (neck) can share any experiences.

I'm having a full excisional biopsy of my submandibular lymph node in a couple of weeks and wondering what to expect. The surgeon said I will definately have a scar but I was wondering what others experience was like. i.e. how was the bruising and swelling afterwards and how long did it take for you to get your results (I have a follow up appointment pencilled in for 7 working days after the biopsy). I have all the symptoms of lymphoma - enlarged lymph nodes in the neck, axillary, groin etc, deep muscle like itch on my legs, night sweats, low blood counts etc so the biopsy will rule this in or out. But what I am looking for is anyone who has had a biopsy of neck lymph nodes and how it went, did you have any swelling, bruising, drainage/wound issues afterwards?

                About 1 year ago, I had a pretty bad case of mononucleosis. My liver was involved among other things and I was down for the count for a few weeks after a couple doctor's appointments. I've had a weaker immune system since, but nothing I couldn't deal with, although it was accompanied by a strong anxiety that I've been battling my entire life. Ever since then, many lymph nodes have either remained or appeared on my neck, groin, and apparently in my abdomen according to a CT scan (although I cannot for the life of me figure out if they were there already or not, and none of them seem to be growing. The biggest ones that have been there since the mono FOR SURE have not grown whatsoever). None of them have gone beyond their original size and I would say the biggest one on my body has been 1.5 cm or thereabouts, with the majority of them being MUCH MUCH smaller. 

This was a concern for me and I had been to many doctors who had kind of blown it off when in May, I experienced three full days of tingling and numbness in my face and behind my right eye. Ever since, I've had many many floaters, tingling in my hands and feet, my arms and feet fall asleep extremely easily, I cannot maintain an erection (very rarely in my sleep will I get one that's about 3/4 capacity which I can also get if I truly attempt to masturbate, although cannot maintain it. Sorry if that's TMI), and I am having the worst anxiety of my life along with all of these unexplained swollen lymph nodes. The sexual dysfunction has progressed. While I was quite sexually active before, I've found myself coming up with excuses not to have sex. As you can imagine, for someone who already has health anxiety, I am having a very difficult time dealing with this situation. I've also had a very dull ache under my right rib for quite some time now, almost like a fullness, but nothing except the lymph nodes has been revealed. 

I do have polycythemia which is idiopathic (high RBCs) although they're unsure if this is related. I've had so many CT scans, MRIs, ultrasounds... I'm so exhausted. For an 18 year old to have all of this going on, the doctors are confused, but are convinced that I'm overreacting. I just want answers to what is going on. This is truly ruining a life that I wish I could enjoy. The last year of my life has been so unenjoyable for me at times, I want to break down. Is there anyone out there who can offer some insight and direction medically as to what I should be doing?

                I have swolen lymph glands under my armpits. They are inflamed and infected with puss.
About 90 days ago I was bitten by what I suspect was a Brown Recluse spider on my chest over my heart. First itching and hives all over my chest then the valcano wound which raised about 1/2 inch and oozed. VERY painful! The wound healed after 8 weeks. The doctor prescribed antibiotics and a steroid ointment.  The swolen gland on on side appeared about a week ago and 
I went to the Doctor 3 days ago when it was evident that I had a bad infection. It spread to the other side and formed a puss podule and the lumps got quite large. The Dr. has me taking Sulfameth/TMP twice a day.  I was told to ""milk"" the glands and did. Alot of puss came out both sides. But after three days of intibiotics there is no improvement.  The condition is quite painful.
I am out of money to go to the doctor and have no insurance. And don't know where to go to get a blood test treatment. Can you help me?

So for the past 2 and a half months I have had this small lump behind my ear.  Sometimes it gets very VERY small and I can barely feel it.  But at other times is grows to about the size of a small pea.  It doesn't really hurt, and is usually not tender to the touch, but it can feel a little irritated on some days.  Is this a sign of lymphoma? I also think I have been having night sweats.  I wake up in the morning and I feel really hot and uncomfortable.

                at the end of june beginning of july of this year my 2 and a half year old son was diagnosed with coxsackie virus. He had an outbreak of Herpangina and had several ulcers in his throat. He had fevers of 102-104 and had a double ear infection on top of all that. After an allergic reaction to the first antiboitic he was switched to another which cleared the ear infection.
My questionis this...I noticed a swollen lymphnode on the backof his neckbut more near the side in the area below his ear. (i too have a swollenlymph node there due to dry scalp issues). I brought him to teh dr about 3 weeks ago and she checked him out and he had no infections anywhere inhisbody. She also checked for other swollen nodes and there were none. she said that he had alot going on inhis throat that could have caused this node to swell and not to touch it for 2 weeks.  She was not concerned at all and this dr is a worrywart! LOL!
 I of course being the worrysome mom felt it after like 4 days and it was still there. He is fine otherwise. playing, eating sleeping doing what a normwl 2 and a half yr old would do.  It is about the size of my pinkynail and seems to be rubbery.
Has anyone else gone thru this similar situation? I read that a virus CAN cause these nodes to swell, i was jsut wondering if anyone else went thru this.
PLEASE NO NEGATIVE COMMENTS! this is a child we are talking about and i dont want SCARED stories! thanks!!!!

I was just diagnosed w/Ulcerative Colitis, but I am concerned that something else is going on here.  I am worried that I might have leukemia;  I experienced terrible night sweats about 3 years ago, (Dr. said not a concern) and most recently, I have noticed small, red petechiae on my belly and upper inner arms, easy bruising (although my platlet count is 364).  I also have unexplainable headaches, and dizziness, often after eating and just general tiredness, and can sweat alot.  I also have pretty bad joint pain, especially in my left shoulder and left knee, but who knows it could be from the colitis.  Here are #'s from a recent CBC;  can anyone tell me if I should be worried and if I should push to see a hematologist & get a bone marrow biopsy?  Could I just be feeling lousy from the Colitis?  Wold my WBC be higher if I had all these symptoms of leukemia?

                Hi i am 20 years old, the past few days my neck kinda felt at times that i may be getting a stiff neck but then it just kinda of went away, and then suddenly after the weekend, i noticed a lump first at the very lowest part of my hair line on the left side of my neck which hurt when touched and increasing in more pain when i turn my head to the right i had my hair up so thought that my head simply just hurt from being pulled back but upon taking it down i felt another hard immobile pea sized bump even with my fore head on the back left side, which hurts even worse. i then thought it felt almost as if there was a soft spot next to it, until i realize there is about a quarter sized lump in width that is not protruded out as much as the other one. Upon waking up this morning im staring to feel two more one is in the back of my neck on the left side approximately mid way between where my neck and back meet and the other seems to be again on the left side behing my ear kind of and in my hair line... i would not be concerned  but i have not been sick lately, and these are all very hard and immobile however very painful, so im just trying to figure out if this is something i should be concerened about...?

Thank you

Hello all 

within the last 9 months my daughter has had several lypmh node issues first started off as groin, she had 2 large swellings and after 2 weeks fluid was drained from behind 2 lymph nodes each side they were left to heal inside to out without stitches.... they do not know why this happened. She was very poorly, pale, glassy eyed, continous clear fluid running from nose, always complaining of belly ache. Very emotional easily upset, very lathargic, sleepless nights, bed wetting.  Since having 3 operations 7-9 months ago ( they operated on the lymph nodes 3 times ) she has had same issues, as explained above less the groin swellings but now has lymph nodes swollen in her cervical (neck)  area each side with the right being more then the left.... from top to bottom.... she has no apparent throat infection however she has been treated with anti-biotics but still has the swellings, she was reffered to an ENT specialist who said he feels its not tonsilitus as she doesnt have the symptoms but is going to remove her tonsils and he feels they are chronically inflamed.... he said she could also have swollen lymph nodes in her tummy hence why she always complains of tummy ache.... im worried that this could be lymphoma as ive never seen a child have 4 operations on lymph nodes within a year she is only 5.  

Can someone give me advice about this, help me in what to do or say to the doctors, as i feel for my daughter whos ill every few days, whos always emotional, always pale, and now always wetting her bed at night.

Thanks :(

                Hello All,

I recently notices a small lump on the right side of my neck. I went to the doctor and he said its most likely a gland issue but requested i get a blood test. I got the test and everything came back normal except i had a low platelet count, i think it was 113,000. I also just noticed i had some small red bumps on my middle finger on one hand.

After reading online ive noticed a few of the symptoms are similar to hogkins disease. However, i do not bruise easily, i am not bleeding alot, nor do i fatigue have any aches and pains. The doctor claims because he never called back after the test its because nothing was wrong

UPDATE: Ive noticed the bump on my neck is a little smaller (still kind of hard i guess).

                Hello,

I’m a 30 year old male and have had a swollen lymph node in on the left hand side of my groin for at least two months now.

I don’t know if all these symptoms are related but I’ll give you a symptom history of the past few months. 

About 3/4 months ago I noticed I needed to urinate more frequently and couldn’t hold it in as long as normal. This problem doesn’t seem as prominent now. 

Then about 2 months ago I first noticed my left lymph node was really swollen, about the size of a small grape. Just running my hands over my groin area I could feel it protruding. The right hand side of my groin was also slightly swollen.

About 6 weeks ago I became ill with a sort of cold. First I felt totally drained and as if my insides had been dried out, my throat also became really dry. I felt faint at times then the cold symptoms appeared - a runny nose and sneezing, then lots of mucus in my sinuses. These symptoms lasted for around 14 days in total, quite a long cold.

I’m not sure if this is anything to do with this but 99% of the time I pass a large stool on a morning, every morning. This has been my routine for years but these last few weeks I feel as if I need to pass stools more frequently but when I go I struggle to get as much as I used to out. This has resulted in me going twice a day and not feeling satisfied with either.

Last week I went to the doctors as my lymph nodes are still enlarged. The one on the left side of my groin has shrunk a little to around the size of a large pea but has held this size for a while now and isn’t shrinking any further. The one on my right is just slightly noticeable now.

The doctor examined it, she said it moved around well which could be a good sign then took some blood tests. Since she examined it (pushing it around) I’ve had small aches and niggles around my groin and lower stomach area. 

I returned for those results yesterday with a different doctor. He said the blood tests came back normal but with ever so slightly increased inflammation markers, so slightly that it wasn’t significant. With the blood test being normal I’m thinking my long cold isn’t related to my lymph node problems? He examined me and said he wasn’t even sure it was a lymph node. He said he had to press real deep to feel it and it could be a fatty deposit. I wasn’t confident in what he said I don’t think he even noticed the one on the right side of my groin. I’m not sure a fatty deposit would grow and shrink like these also. 

I’ve had glandular fever about 10 years ago and they tested for that and that came back negative. I’m from the UK and haven’t been abroad or near any cats lately either.

I have to return to the doctors in two weeks for a follow up review and to take things for there. I’m really worried and stressed about this, two weeks before anything further happens. 

Any suggestions or advice would be great!

Thank you.

                I've noticed that my lymph node under my right earlobe feels like a hard ball (kind of moves around) for 3 months. Sometimes when my neck muscles are tight it will feel more pronounced and my ear feels plugged. I've had a cough that went away with antibiotics and it seemed the node went down too temporarily. Then the doc looked into my sinus cavities and noticed they were red, so she said I had a sinus infection (without drainage or stuffiness). Sometimes the roof of my mouth itches and my ear itches on the side of the node. I'm having a hard time believing it's just my sinuses irritated. I actually came down with shingles recently too. I don't know if it was from the stress or my immune system is weak. Everytime I mention it to the doctor she says the nodes go up and down all the time and was not concerned. Then another doctor said the same thing. They know I'm a bit of hypochondriac so I feel they blow me off when I come in with an unresolved concern. I just want to hear that maybe I'm over reacting. And if I did have something serious going on with the node what other symptoms would I have. Maybe I should just pay to see an ENT out of my own pocket. I have an HMO and everything has to go through the lovely PC!!! Any advice like waiting it out or going right in....

                Can somebody please try to shed some light on my situation!! 

Around 4-5 months ago my lymph nodes began swelling, one by one I've noticed them all popping up: Infraclavicular, groin, neck, behind ear...EVERYWHERE! 
These have been accompanied by a multitude of symptoms such as: 

Fatigue, low grade fever, headaches, nausea, constant ringing in my ears, neuropathy (constant facial twitches), a thick white coating on my tongue, a mild blotchy rash on my arms and stomach and a burning sensation on my arms. 

I've been to and fro to the doctor and everything is ""fine"", I've had comprehensive blood testing, everything is ""fine"". 
The only thing I've noticed recently is a slight decrease in my Leukocyte level, but still within normal ranges. 
I feel like I'm going a little crazy here....I feel quite terrible on a daily basis and I'm supposed to be healthy!! 

It's really been wearing my down over the last few months and am not too sure what to do!! 
Is there anybody out there who could offer me some advice on where to go next?! 
I have no real idea what could be causing this all so am wondering if these symptoms align with either Leukemia or Lymphoma.

I'm a 25 y/o male, no history of illness. Smoker. Relatively healthy. 

PUZZLED.

I've had this for about 6 months or so and today I noticed that when I raised my head the lump was visible through the skin. My parents kept on telling me that it was probably just a swollen gland but it's grown and now it's visible. I don't think thats normal. It's above my adam's apple and on the left side of my neck. It's also the size of a large marble. Please shed some light for me. I've been worried that it may be a lymphoma, I would really appreciate the help.

                Hi,

To keep the story short, here is my history:

I am 24, male, 5'8"" & 150lbs. I had a pacemaker put in on Oct/08 for bradycardia. Diagnosed with Celiac Disease on November 2009. In February 2010, I had an Ultrasound that showed slight mesenteric lymph node enlargement and a slightly enlarged spleen (13inches). Both were minimal so my doctor said not to worry. Recently I had 2 lymph nodes which feel stuck together appear in my right armpit, took about 1 month for them both to surface. They are quite deep and i need to push in to feel them, but one is about the size of a small marble and the other about a pea. They are not huge, but definately were not there before.

Because of this I went to see my doctor to get it reviewed. During the exam, a few other small nodes were felt in my neck and a couple under my jaw. Due to there being quite a few, my doctor set up an ultrasound of my stomach, armpit and neck. She said that see just wanted to make sure it was lymphoma, but reassured me that it likely wasn't since they were not too large and had some give to them.

On top of these small nodes, my relevant blood work in the past has been up and down. Here are my lowest and highest numbers, followed by my most recent:

Lowest and Highest over last year
-----------------------------------
RBC- Lowest:3.5 Highest:4.5 (normal 4.5 - 7)
WBC- Lowest:4.0 Highest:6.5 (normal 4.0 - 11)
Platelet- Lowest:150 Highest:185 (normal 150-400)
Abs Lymphocyte- Lowest:600 Highest:1000 (normal 1500-4000)
Abs Retic Count- Lowest:13 Highest:15 (normal 25-100)

Most Recent: June 20, 2010
------------------------------
RBC- 4.4
WBC- 4.0
Platelet- 180
Abs Lymphocyte- 800 (a little bit low)
Abs Retic Count- 14 (low)

Both numbers did not disturb my doctor too much and was just left to wait and see.

I'm assuming it is nothing serious and all will be back to normal once I get my ultrasound done. I'm just looking for some reassurance or information regarding my history. Does this sound like it will most likely just be nothing? I'm thinking so, but I felt like asking people with past experience would be the best.

Thanks in advance.

                Hi,

Over the last two years I've had array of things go wrong, from getting a pacemaker at age 22 for low heart rate, to low blood pressure, to now tachycardia events (so am on betablocker), to finally a diagnosis of Celiac Disease in November.

Over these two years, I've always been either mildy anemic or borderline low, never any higher. Also my WBC has always been between 4.0-6.5 and I've had chronic mildly low lymphocytes during this time.

Over the last few months I had an ultrasound that found Lymph nodes in my neck (largest 1.4cm x 0.8cm) and in my armpit (largest 2.5 x 0.8cm). The ultrasound also found an 8mm thyroid nodule. I was scheduled for an FNA of the nodule, but over a month the nodule now appears to no longer be there, but I have had a more worrisome looking nodule starting to grow on the right side at 6mm (hypoechoic and ill-defined margins). 

During the time of all these findings my Absolute Lymphocyte count has gone done from 1100 to 900 to now 650 (reference range 1500-4000), while my WBC count has stayed the same at around 5.5 (ref range 4 - 11). My GP is getting a little concerned as why my lymphocytes continue to go down while my WBC stays the same, as usually with an infection your WBC goes up. I am scheduled for a biopsy of my armpit lymph node but I am not worried since the ultrasound said it didn't appear to be malignant. 

I have just felt really worn down of the last few months, not sick, just really weak. I don't feel like it is Lymphoma as I do not have night sweats, but I was hoping somebody here would have insight onto lymph nodes or lymphocyte counts. 

Here are my latest lab results from Tuesday. 

WBC: 5.76 (range 4 - 11)
ABS Neutrophils: 4.19 (ref range 2.0 - 6.3)
ABS Lymphocytes: 0.65 (ref range 1.5 - 3.5)
ABS Monocytes: 0.57 (ref range 0.2 - 0.8)
ABS Eosinophils: 0.31 (ref range 0.04 - 0.4)
ABS Basophils: 0.03 (ref range 0.00 - 0.1)

RBC: 4.3 (ref range 4.3 - 5.6)
Hemoglobin (HGB): 135 (range 130 - 170)
Hematocrit (HCT): 38.5 (range 40 - 50)
PLT: 190 (range 140-400)

B12: 276 (range 220 - 1000)
Ferritin: 71 (range 50-80=reduced, >80=normal)

Thanks.

                My son is 5 years old and we are currently 6 months into his maintenance protocal on the Standard Arm Protocal.  We have had to triple his doses so far.  His neut counts haven't dropped below the 1.5 of what they are looking for.  They have ordered metabolic test but the results are not back yet.  At the time of diagnosis he was put into the Average Risk group due to a high WBC.
Can you please tell me what exactly the test is looking for and how this can effect his treatment.  I am aware that some people have a resistance to chemotherapy, can a bone marrow transplant be an effective treatment if the Chemo isn't working?
Is it also possible that the chemo is still working even though his counts are not dropping?  He has never really been sick from the treatment, the only drugs that have had any adverse effects on him were the Doxorubicin and L-Asparaginase.

                I'm a college student in recovery from ALL, its been an off and battle between remission and relapse for three years now. I'm in remission now and on maintenance therapy: weekly MTX, monthly vincristine, daily mercaptopurine, and intrathecal MTX every 3 months. Over the past couple of weeks I've fainted 4 times. It starts with dizziness and then my vision tunnels in until I black out. Then I wake to find myself being carried to the nearest couch. I'm especially worried because I'm moving back into the dorm this weekend and don't want to freak people out. They are already worried enough. And my boyfriend has already freaked out about it. This is not normal for me at all. I can't tell my parents because my Dad's a Dr. and would probably throw me back into the hospital. And I'm afraid to go in to my oncologist because the thought of another relapse scares me to death. I don't know what to do. I desperately need some feedback. If anybody can relate to my situation, please reply. Thanks

After the first week, i went to see my normal physician who said it was a swollen lymph node, which seems to fit what ive found on the internet. He said it was very small, only about 2/3 a centimeter (personally i think its slightly larger but i suppose he knows better). He said it was probably caused by a small infection or virus that i might not have even noticed. It hasnt changed size for the 3 weeks, but it definitely hasnt gone away. Im concerned because of the fact that most sites say they should go away after 2 weeks or so, and also that it is painless. I have found things that say painless swollen lymph nodes could be a sign of some sort of cancer?? i know that 16 seems too young but i cant be sure. Im going to call the doctors, maybe see my physician, again in a few days but...anyways. i looked up the symptoms for non-hodgkins lymphoma and i dont have too many of the symptoms (and they all seem like they could be unrelated). I have the enlarged node on my head (which they say is uncommon). I dont have a fever. The only things that might point to it are my ear has been itching wierdly recently (again, could be unrelated) and in the mornings my stomach feels kinda full. Any help guys? Thanks in advance im just starting to worry about this!

                Hi All, 

First post here , hoping I can get some advice , I have enlarged lymph nodes in 4 different ares (mensteric , Groin , Submandular & mediastinal) for the last 2 months, I and heve been treated with anti-biotics but nodes still enlarged , my recent follow up CT scan also revealed mediastinal lymphadenopathy , paratracheal nodes enlarged , subcarinal lymphadenopathy but no mention of Hiliar adenopathy , also mentioned was ""minor scarring at the apex of the right lung and irregular nodule centrally in the  right apex of 1 x 2.9 cm which may represent scarring but a small irregular mass lesion cannot be excluded"" , I wondering would this be looking like a sarcoid case? my understanding is that Hiliar adenopathy would need to be present to make a Sarcoid diagnosis? Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

                Hi,

I was wondering if someone could shed some light on these symptoms. My daugher is 4 years old and has had swollen cervical lymph glands for over two years, more recently they are more swollen and more plentiful, not painful.  She has two large glands, 3-4cm diametre on both sides of her neck and several small pea sized glands on both sides as well.  She has been complaining of stomach pain and has also had a persistant cough for over a year. She seems to tire easily when playing. I've only recently seen our GP, blood test results show RBC (hemaglobin) to be 11.2, WBC were normoal as well as thyroid and kidneys.  she is being referred to a pediatrician, but the GP said it could take up to 6 weeks!!! 
Should I push for a chest x-ray and biopsy?  GP said there is nothing he can do to get the appointment sooner because he symptoms have been around for so long another 6 weeks isn't going to make any difference.  I think she may have lymphoma after reading symptoms online.  I'm worried because her symptoms have been around for so long but I've been brushing them off as nothing and now feel really guilty.

I have a lump beneath my chin area for about almost a year now. Got it checked in March this year and the doctor said nothing to worry about unless you feel pain. Just 2 days ago, i've been feeling pain around that region especially when i turn my neck sideways. How do I know if its lymphoma? Must the pain persist or worsen and if so how long? I'm really freaking out. :(( What test can I get done to clarify this condition I have? Thank You so much.

                My husband was diagnosed with CLL October 2009. He has had quarterly blood work done and they have been fairly stable. He just had his last labs on 7/15 and his neutrophils were in the 19% range and we were told normal is 50-70% range. His lymphocytes are 79% and normal is 20-50% . His WBC went from 34.4 on 4/16/10 to 45.0 on 7/15. He also has a slightly enlarged spleen, which his oncologist said is nothing to really worry about at this time. Easier said than done.
We are still new at trying to understand all the numbers, so we want to know how often the numbers will fluctuate. He has been feeling more tired than usual lately also. Would the low neutrophils be the reason for him being more tired than usual lately? Thank you.

Thank you so much for your comments and your interest. We have checked all the stuff you said (I think, told you, big secret society in the U.K.) Had her 2nd bag today, don't know hb yet, will call tomorrow.Looks bit better this evening but very slow bag today as b.p. very low ( don't ask me, they don't tell you).
But you know your own and I just have a niggle that there's something not quite right. I'll let you know. Have asked for weekly hb, will save all this suffering but don't think this is going to be a good or stable time here from now on. Unfortunately, and very sadly, I feel the prognosis is as bad as it gets. Hoope I'm wrong.
Take care, thanks again, will speak soon.

                I'm a 29 year old male. I've been dealing with fatigue for almost 8 months. I had pericarditis back in December and it's cleared up. I had mono back in 2005 and have dealt with fatigue here and there since but it's been pretty persistant since October. Since January I've had numerous blood tests and had them as recently as last month when I had a heart cath performed, I've had an ANA, SED rate and all the counts have been normal. I went and saw an Internal Doctor last week and she's running more blood tests. My symptoms are as followed- fatigue, muscle and joint aches, constant sore throat, back and neck pain. No bleeding, no weight loss, I can't notice any enlarged lymphnodes. My left side is tender but its been that way since I feel on some cement about 3 years ago. Here are the tests I've had- heart cath, chest CT, chest Xrays, abdominal CT about a year ago, countless blood work(only abnormality was slightly low potassium). My dad died at 43 from leukemia and while I've heard it generally doesn't run in families it still creeps into the back of my mind. I would imagine if it was something like leukemia something would have shown up on the bloodwork,xrays or scans- the only other thing I can think of is fibromyalgia or Chronic Fatigue Syndrome- and advice would be greatly appreciated.

Is this normal, has it happened to you? I'm such a hypochondriac. I have a cancer phobia and I've researched all the cancers in the past. I know with Leukemia you bruise easily. Would that be classified as easy?

Or is this nothing to worry about?

                On Wednesday of last week, my boyfriend found a swollen lymph node under his jaw towards the front of his neck (it's localized and is only swollen on his neck). Over the past few days it has increased in size and is tender (painful) to touch. From Thursday to Saturday he became increasingly fatigued and had headaches whenever he moved (he remained pretty active on Wed -Thurs (basketball, running), slept all day friday then played softball. He slept the rest of the weekend (fever, headaches, loss of appetite) went to the doctor's office on Monday and they are doing blood tests and his results were normal. He mono test was negative. He went back to the doctor today for a chest x ray (also looked normal without any other swollen lymph nodes). The doctor prescribed penicillin and stated that if the lymph node  did not go down then he would have to get a biopsy. He still feels fatigued with low grade fever (99-100), but his appetite is back. 

I initially thought it was just a flu, but the doctor is alarmed by the size of the swollen lymph node. Is it often to have a localized swollen lymph node and flu like symptoms that turn out to be some type of lymphoma? I'm just nervous for him. What should we expect?

As a note he was tested for all STDs in March and was clean (he tested 12 weeks after any possible exposure to anything).

The size has remained the same. I am 16 years old and rather worried about this. I have a doctors appointment next month but I'm still very anxious and concerned on what might be going on. Some people say it might be an infection but I feel completely fine. The one thing I am worried about is lymphoma but the size hasn't changed and I have no symptoms. Also, I have a small infection in my ear lobes from my ear pierces which cause them to be itchy and hurt. Can this type of infection be related?

                I've been on klonopin for 4 months and all I take is 1mg at night for sleep, I've been to mayo clinic for every test imaginable, thyroid, brain MRI, at least 15 blood test for various things, and MRI of the stomach and upper end. And colonoscopy. Here are my symptoms: body feeling shaky- like a tremor, not like a parkinsons shaking all over but I can feel it internally and hands are slightly shaky, the next symptom is an everyday headache on my left side only, which is a tingling sensation not really throbbing and finally my body specifically on my back feels like it's burning up and is very warm to the touch. My question is: can klonopin be causing all of these symptoms? Is my body going through mini-withdrawal craving the next dose? Or does this this sound like something else?

                My mom was initially diagnosed with CLL, but then they changed it to ATLL (adult t-cell leukemia/lymphoma).  Her most recent blood work was a little confusing, so I wanted to get some help understanding it.  

FIRST QUESTION:  

MID 6.5  11.5%M   
The 6.5 result was flagged as high as the normal range was 0.0 to 1.8.  However the percentage 11.5% result was normal as the normal range was 0.0% to 15%.  

How can the percentage be normal if the MID is high.  And really, what does this mean anyway?

SECOND QUESTION:

GRAN 6.4  11.3%G
The 6.4 result was normal.  However the 11.3%G was flagged as low as the normal range was 37% to 80%G

How can the percentages and the numerical results not be BOTH normal or BOTH high....how can one be high (or low) and the other be normal?

THIRD QUESTION:

Her PLT was flagged as low for a value of 80 when the normal range was indicated 142-424.  What is the significance of this?


Thanks for the help.  I really, really appreciate it.

                Good afternoon, 

I am a thirty year old female in general good health.  I suffer from allergies (seasonal, environmental, animal, and food) and have a family history of the following: diabetes (father, his two brothers and their father), thyroid disease (sister and mother), hypertension (mother and father), and heart disease (both sides).  As well, my grandfather recently passed away from prostate/bone cancer and my father has a benign prostate growth.  In January 2010 I discovered a lump in my left armpit.  This lump is under the skin, painless and hard.  It's difficult for me to tell when I palpate it if it is moveable, or if it is just the skin and muscle that is moving around it.  I went to see my family physician within weeks of discovering this lump.  It was palpated, my right armpit was also checked, and I was asked if I had any concerns about my breasts, which I did not.  The physician stated that it was an enlarged lymph node, that I was probably dealing with a viral infection, and left it at that.  I did end up coming down with acute bronchitis in April 2010 and had it for two months.  However, I have now recovered from the bronchitis, yet the lump is still present and undiminished in size.  In addition, I have been having some issues breathing (specifically, taking a deep enough breath and feeling like I can get enough oxygen).  I have been doing a lot of research and have another appointment scheduled with my family physician to discuss my concerns further, but I was wondering, given the description and passage of time, what yuor first impressions would be concerning this lump (and/or breathlessness)?  Any information you could provide would be very much appreciated, as I am quite concerned.  Thank you!

all these differ from standard value? what might be the disease? is there any probability of lymphoma?

                Hello,  just last night I found a small hard rock( feels like a bone) lump behind my ear. I wouldve never known it was there if it wasn't for me feeling behind my ear. I'm a bit of a hypochondriac so naturally I over reacted and poked at it all night...I'm wondering if it could be a swollen lymph node. however it's not painful and the only reason the skin around it is red is because of me touching it so much, also the skin around it is starting to itch. I press down on it and it feel like a little hard as rock ball....help please?

 Everywhere Ive looked they seem to be abit lower.. It doesnt hurt or anything not got any other bumps anywhere else. It came up after football.. Any ideas.. Im getting quite anxious about it being something dodgy. My mum thinks its a tendon or ligament or bit of muscle thats pushed through..

                I'm a 26year old female. Since the age of 21, I have had a swollen lymph node, on my inner right thigh, that started out at about the size of a penny(diameter). It is now the size of a 50 cent coin.  I first discovered this lump/lymph node/cyst at the age of 21, during my first pregnancy. My Ob/Gyn told me that it was more than likely just a cyst, and would go away after the birth of my baby. Its over 4years later now, and it's still there, and hasn't gone away. One other thing, i find to be somewhat odd and curious, is that since i've had this swollen lymph node, or whatever it is ... I have been losing weight. I'm 5'10 and I was 221lbs upon getting pregnant. 4 years and another child later I now am 151lbs, and i honestly haven't dieted or exercised. I always feel tired, stomach is upset and am always getting headaches and feeling lightheaded. I want to talk to my GP about it, but I'm a little scared, and very embarassed, cosmetically it is gruesome to me, and I don't even want to wear shorts or a bathing suit anymore. I would really appreciate some feedback, as to what in the world this might be. thank you for your time.

                Hi, 

I was diagnosed with Celiac's Disease last Novemeber and have since been gluten free. On my checkup in January I had an enlarged spleen found during examination. I recently had some blood work done and had an ultrasound of my abdomen to check for an enlarged spleen. 

Here are the results of my blood work and Ultrasound:

Slightly prominent non-specific mesenteric lymph nodes in lower right quadrant, which may be reactive. 

The doctor who ran the tests asked me to follow up with my family doctor. My GP isn't too concerned since they say non-specific and may be reactive. My only concern is the risk of celiac and small bowel lymphoma. Since these lymph nodes are beside my intestines, should this now draw further investigation? 

Any people with experiences or suggestions is appreicated.

                I am a male and I am 22 years old. I just graduated from college. Over the past few months I have had digestive problems, throat and abdominal discomfort, and weight loss. Here are my symptoms:

Almost every day I feel that part of my throat is swollen and I have a dull ache/discomfort in my throat. Sometimes it is higher in my throat, near my tonsils, and other days it is lower at the base of my throat (I’m assuming near my thyroid?). The discomfort is pretty consistently on the left side of my neck/throat.  This has been going on for over a month now. I am not sure if my lymph nodes are actually swollen or not, but there is a general tightness or swelling feeling in my throat. The dull ache is not the type of pain associated with strep throat; it is more of a discomfort. Last week I noticed that I have a sore (red circle) at the base of my uvula, and this week I have one white spot on my right tonsil. 

When I wake up every morning, my upper abdomen aches, especially on the left side under my rib cage. Also, my armpits ache some mornings (maybe lymph nodes?). As the day progresses, my abdominal pain seems to move down lower towards my lower left abdomen, but occasionally also aches on the right side too. The abdominal pain seems to worsen after meals or after bowel movements sometimes. I used to have diarrhea every day, when I was eating everything that I wanted to.  Recently I have changed my diet and my diarrhea has been better for the most part, but I still have soft, broken stools. 

Currently my diet consists of gluten free and dairy free foods. This diet does make me feel better (especially less diarrhea and more energy), but my left abdomen and the left part of my throat still feel very uncomfortable and ache constantly. It almost feels as if the left part of my body is sick, while the right side is doing fine (I know this sounds crazy). 

I have been to the doctor twice, the first time I was put on a proton pump inhibitor for possible indigestion/heart burn, and I had a blood test done. The blood test came back and I had no red flags, no signs of celiac and no signs of liver problems. The proton pump inhibitor didn’t seem to do anything for me. The second time I went back to the doctor he had me get another blood test to check for mono (still waiting on the results) and he suggested that I go to a digestive specialist. I have lost a lot of weight in the last month. I have gone from 184 lbs to 167 lbs in one month (lost 17 lbs.), and I am not sure if it is due to this illness, or if it is because I am home from college and I have been living a healthier lifestyle. 

My symptoms seem to get worse when I eat unhealthy. Also, my body can’t withstand alcohol. After even a few sips of alcohol my throat feels as if it swells up even more than before, also my abdominal pain gets much worse after I drink half of a beer. I have decided to completely cut out alcohol because of this.

Overall I don’t have a fever, I don’t have night sweats, I don’t really have any other complications except the ones above. Could this be lymphoma, pancreatitis, food allergies, hyperthyroidism, or mono? I have no idea what’s causing this but it’s having a big impact on my quality of life lately.

                My son (aged 2) has 3 enlarged nodes in his neck, one over 2inch long and pretruding, and one in his groin.  He has seen the pedritician and they have said that 2 in his neck and 1 in his groin are all within the normal limits (although the one is larger than a grape?) the one that is longer than two inches she said was larger than normal but felt ok to her.  They did a blood count (normal) and test for glandular fever and told me to not worry. 

This was last week, and I can't stop worrying - especially when I am sure that the large 1 is still growing and I know that the blood test can't rule out lymphoma.  I pray that I am worrying for nothing but until they're gone I won't be able to stop. 

Do you think I should ask for further test or just accept the doctors opinion and do my best to forget about it?

Anyone who has suffered through the emotional pain and self doubt of a difficult diagnosis, knows that this was a crushing blow.  

I have been diagnosed with Sjogren's disease, which by the way is often linked with lymphoma.  My case is severe with many complications.  

I don't know what I wrote that caused such doubt, but I urge those who would be quick to judge to be careful.  

Just be kind and careful.

I do have a written dictation of the test and it showed that I have shotty lymph nodes bilaterally in my neck.  3 years ago, the Radiologist found an enlarged lymph node in my armpit.  I do have episodes of sweating but I can't say that I have night sweats.  My husband has told me when I'm sweating that it's not hot enough to sweat.  

My MRI also shows gliosis of the brainstem.  (My brainstem has damage from something but they aren't sure from what.  They are pretty sure it's not from the MS though)

A couple of months ago, the muscles in my breast and chest became very sore.  It felt as if the muscles were being ripped off the bone.  It was difficult to raise my right arm and turn the steering wheel.  I'm not sure if this would be related to the shotty lymph nodes in my neck.  No mention of any enlarged nodes in the subclavian area.

Does anyone have any ideas on this?  Thanks if you do.  Any ideas are helpful.

It is smaller than a pea (I think), it does not hurt when pressed and it can’t be seen. There is a little discomfort in my neck but I do not think it is from it. 
Is it OK to feel your lymph node?
Is it true that when you keep feeling the node will cause them to enlarge?
Is it OK to have it for that long with the current size (pea size or smaller)?

                I'll try not to sound like a broken record... just don't have enough time to scroll thru all the messages threads to try to figure this one out. 

I've been battling a mystery illness for about 3 months. Started with diahrea, pnuemonia, and fatigue. But for the past 2 months, I've had strange body pains. Not pulled muscles, but a dull to moderate pain in my left arm, sides, groin, and right knee.  All in lymph node areas. There has been no swelling that I've found, but the discomfort is really bothering me. Now I have a pressure and numbness above my right ear, that has moved from in front of the ear (jaw joint), to behind the ear at base of skull (end of the boney part), and now right above my right ear and slightly back.

Throat has also been irritated, but not sore.... but has had that ""lump"" feeling it it for a while.  Had blood work done twice, earliest was May 3rd. Everything was fine, except it showed I an elevated EBV levels, but the doctor said it just showed an earlier case of Mono, but not a current one. 

To sum things up. What could cause lymph area PAIN, with no swelling. If a person has an infection in the lymph nodes, shouldn't they swell? 

Any help would be greatly appreciated....

user_988003,rvaughn,/posts/Leukemia-and-Lymphoma-/Chronically-Abnormal-CBCs-Cause-for-concern/show/1279431,Chronically Abnormal CBCs... Cause for concern?,"
                Today, I had my 4th CBC done (ordered by different physicians each time) over the last year. I noticed this afternoon, looking back, each CBC showed elevated WBC and Neutrophils and suppressed Lymphocytes. About a year ago, there was cause for concern over possible Thyroid Cancer due to extremely high T4 and almost undectable TSH, however, after having a Thyroid Uptake Scan, it was ruled out. A few months later I became pregnant and haven't had a single abnormal thyroid panel since. However, at 22 weeks I went into preterm labor and delivered my son prematurely with no explanation. I was told there were no genetic abnormalities, all pathology came back fine, and there was no sign of infection. Up until the last year, I frequently had sinus infections. I've consistently weighed between 101-106lbs since the age of 16 and I'm 5'4"" tall. In addition, prenatal panel showed HIV was negative.

Reference Ranges for this lab are: 
WBC 4.5-11.0, Neutrophils 40-70, Lymphocytes 22-44
My labs are as follows:
6/24/09: 
WBC 7.7, Neutrophils 87.5, Lymphocytes 6.1
9/2/09:
WBC 12.5, Neutrophils 74, Lymphocytes 19.8
12/17/09:
WBC 15.8, Neutrophils 84, Lymphocytes 11
6/30/10:
WBC 11.9, Neutrophils 81.3, Lymphocytes 12.4

At this point, I'm concerned if the values seem typical of a Leukemic state or some other type of malignancy? The reason I ask here is because the same physician has not ordered all of these CBCs and I wonder if it is something that is concerning enough to be presented to my new OB for further study. I hope you could give me some type of helpful advice!

Thank You,
Rachael

                I have had a feeling like a lump in my throat when I swollow on the right side just under my jaw bone at first it didnt hurt at all just was annoying  But during the last almost 5 months now it began to get worse and would feel kind of like a burning sensation when I would drink drinks.... I started getting really really bad headaches where I was taking about 16 OTC Ibprofein a day. and just generaly not feeling  so good.  I took some antibiotics that I already had thinking I must have some kind of infection. When nothing changed I went to the doc and he gave me more antibiotcs and did blood tests which came back normal I went to another doc who said that he could feel the small mass in my salivary gland or it could be a lymph node. ordered an upper Gi and Ultrasound then before I got the tests done I noticed another hard fixed lump on the side of my neck that does not hurt but it sticks out and is hard. 

I had my tests all done today but really would like to know a non sugar coated answer as to what can be wrong with me.

                In September of 2009, I had been experiencing some strange symptoms (night sweats, high grade fever (103), foamy urine with dark tint, sore throat, cold sweats, the shakes, itchy hands and feet, swollen lymph nodes etc.) It took a week before I was finally told I had mononucleosis. My liver tests were apparently off the charts and my spleen was swollen. The doctor put me on prednisone and eventually I recovered. 

Since then, the lymph nodes had stayed swollen, my hands and feet continued to be itchy, I have had green phlegm consistently in the mornings, my tonsils are somewhat swollen (my left more than the right) and my urine still seemed to be foamy and strangely colored. It was only a few weeks ago that I went to the doctor again after experiencing numbness, tingling, floaters (only when my eyes are irritated by light), diarrhea on some days, and pretty bad light sensitivity suspecting a brain tumor that I discovered I have secondary polycythemia (heightened RBCs, Hemoglobin, and hematocrit). Nothing else was abnormal on the blood test. I insisted on a brain and spinal cord MRI (with and without contrast) to find nothing there. I then had an abdominal CT scan to check for lesions on my kidneys and liver to find nothing except that I had some swollen lymph nodes in my abdomen (the largest being one 1 centimeter). 

I see my hematologist on Monday, but my anxiety is getting the best of me. I'm worried that I have lymphoma that has spread to my eyes and abdomen. I do have OCD, but I am only 18 and this is a very difficult thing to go through, especially when I am unsure of what a lot of these medical terms mean. Is there anyone that can shed light on what this could possibly be or tell me what the severity of what I have may be if this is indeed lymphoma?  I'm constantly pushing doctors to do a biopsy and it seems like they all want to avoid it and that it's nothing to worry about, but I don't feel right. My ENT feels like it is a viral or bacterial infection, but that doesn't explain swollen nodes in the abdomen to me.

However I am worried about my hair loss, I know its temporary, but I am getting married this year in June and would like to preserve my hair at least till then. Has anyone had ABVD chemotherapy? If so, when did you experience hair loss? How long did it take to grow back?

Please advise thank you!

                I had unprotected oral sex with someone very questionable in indonesia. I can't be hundred percent sure what else may have happened. I  have had the 12 week HIV result come back negative and syphilis negative. I also had a full blood check ( not sure what that entails....blood counts etc ) also did test for thyroid and liver function. The GP said it all came back normal. My only concern is over the last 6 weeks ( since mid late april) my right shoulder area has slowly become swollen. Especially under my collar bone. The swelling seems to be in my elbow and forearm as well. My back has been sore and swollen in the mid left of my back. Sometimes the back of my head, neck and ear is numb.  Also I have swollen gland/tendon or muscle on the  side of my left hip. I have burning sensations sometimes on my torso, arm and right side of face ( not so common at the moment). The collar arm area is starting to become quite sore. Some factors to consider is that I am 24. I have generally been healthy. I have been quite anxious and emotional about the whole HIV thing. I have been sexually abstinent in for the last three years until this happened. I don't take drugs and don't drink much. My father died from Bowel cancer when he was 46 ( 10 years ago). I have been a bit fatigued latley ( but I have been on sleeping pills for bad sleep).
So considering all this what should be my next course of action? I feel my doctors shrugs off my symptoms and thinks I am hypochondriac. I might go to another doctor for another opinion. What's your opinion? What course of action should I be taking? Could a symptom like this be purely down to anxiety and emotional exhaustion? The only thing is that this lymphoma thing that it is sticking around.  I am very concerned. Could i be experiencing soem form of Non-Hodgikens Lymphoma?

                I have had a low WBC for several months ranging from 2.3 to 5.6, now back down to 3.3.  The breakdown of my WBCs is perfect...all percentages are fine.  I feel fine, have had no symptoms, no pain, no fatigue.  My doctor wants to do a bone marrow biopsy just to rule out anything bad.  He can't do it until the end of October.  He doesn't seem concerned, he even said I could wait until after the first of the year if I wanted to.  I don't want to wait, I'd do it tomorrow if I could b/c I think I'm going to have an ulcer from worrying until then.  I had a dear friend die of leukemia at my age.  Everything I've read about leukemia suggest that it causes a HIGH wbc, not a LOW wbc...but when I type in causes of leukopenia (low wbc), leukemia always comes up.  But, usually when I go to that link it again talks about a high wbc.

In a nutshell, I'm wondering when you have a cbc, is the wbc only the healthy wbc's or is it all wbc's?  Also, any other comments specifically on leukemia and how it may affect wbc.  Drs. out there, do you think I should be concerned and press for an earlier biopsy?  Thanks for your comments.

                Hi, I developed a hard lump under my right jaw after some very dodgy dental work 6 months ago.  I was nauseated, dizzy, my ears were ringing, had headaches and no energy for a month solid.  Since I found out the name of the shot he tried 6 different times to give me... gow gate and apparently one shot should have done the trick.  
Fast forward to two weeks ago.  I was diagnosed with Urea Plasma and was given my first dose of antibiotics which made me very sick so I stopped after 3 days.  Another antibiotic was prescribed and that too made me very sick.  I had night sweats, no energy, nauseated and couldn't eat anything.  Then I developed itchy skin which my doctor and I thought was from one of my dogs who we suspected had mites.  Again, I was given medication, Stombectol and this also made me very sick within 24 hours.  My lymph nodes on the right side of my neck became very large and tender.  It was then that I realized the lump that developed and hardened after my dentist was one of the lymph.  Now I am noticing these tiny little red ***** spots on my stomach and inside my thighs... what are these?
When I plug my symptoms into the computer up pops lymphoma... could that have developed after all those shots from the dentist?  My doctor thinks that I have an infection so my lymph are swollen so he prescribed more antibiotics but I don't have a sore throat except to swallow from the swollen lymph.  Apparently one of the stronger side effects of Strombectol are swollen lymph.  I have no insurance and I don't want to go back to any more doctors cause they are just prescribing more expensive medication.... help!

                I have a question about various symptoms that my 8 year old has had.  He has been sick on/off for about 6-8 weeks.  He has had various infections which we thought were colds, and would run fever on/off.  Then was sick for about 7 days with diarrhea.  We did take him to the doctor during that time, and they wanted to give it another week and see how things went. The diarrhea stopped.  Then he got another respiratory infection, and was sick over 7-10 days.  After about 7 days, out of the clear blue he started running a fever around 101.  He hasn't had his normal energy level, or his normal appetite.  Looking back over the last few months, he has been sick more than he has been well.  We did take him back to the doctor again, and they ordered blood work.  We are waiting for the results.  He is now having diarrhea again, but the fever is now gone.  So over the last 6-8 weeks he has had respiratory infections, diarrhea and fever on/off.  I would appreciate any feedback of ideas of what this could be.  I am hoping for the best, but of course the worst is also in my mind.  Thank you for your time.

                My Grandfather has had his lungs drained 3 times in the past 3 months. They say it's possible that his chemotherapy for leukemia is the cause but they are not quite sure. 

He has a terrible pain in the middle of his upper back from a previous back surgery that he believes could be causing it. They used a form of cement in the surgery and he mentioned if any of it got loose it could cause an embolism on the lung or something like that.

What is the more probable cause of the fluid? Any good info on this at all would be a great help!

                Hi,
I am having a 5 year old son. He has frequent bleeding from his nose. We consulted a doctor and got his blood test done.
Below are the results.
Haemogolbin : 10.6 gms%                          RBC: 3.7 mil/cmm
WBC: 6,700 cells/mm                                Packed Cell Volume: 32 vol%
Neutrophils: 47%                                       Eosinophils: 03%   
Lymphocytes: 47%                                    Monocytes: 03%
Platelet Count: 373000 /Cumm                   Protrombin Time is 14 sec

My kid had a viral fever 10 days back but he is fine now.

Haemogolbin is low,
Lymphocytes are high
Protrombin Time is high

What does this mean and how would this impact my kid? What is the next step that needs to be taken?

Thanks in advance.

Hello,

I really need some help and advice my daughter sept oct nov 2009 was quite poorly and the lymph nodes in her groin swelled she had 3 operations within 18 days in october 2009 where they drained some fluid behind her lymph nodes and finally took a biopsy.... prior to this she had no issues with health no recurrent colds never an ill child at all.... they told me the biopsy was clear they didnt go into details to what they tested for or anything. she was discharged and continued to have check ups as her wounds were left to heal without stitches.... then she was told she didnt need to be seen again..... 
since then she has had numerous colds, and sickness episodes and just recently she has had a continous runny nose for the past 5 weeks its not green its white / clear colour but its continuous and also has started having episodes of nose bleeds only down 1 side of her nostral.... 
She is also having terrible terrible nights sleeping for instance last night she was up and down from 12a.m to 3a.m then up at 6a.m i took her to school as usual as she seemed fine in herself but i was contacted and told to collect her at midday as she continously kept bursting into tears.  Sometimes she says her tummy hurts but as a 5 year old (almost 5 end of june) doesnt really know how to express her feelings properly.... 
Can anyone give me any advice have you ever heard or experienced anything like this? I do check her scars and her groin area regularly and theres no swelling i can see there at the moment and i have been giving her hayfever / allergy meds for 7 days with no effect on the runny nose situation....

Any advice would be so very very much appriciated 

Thank you

                Hi all , you americans make me giggle! You know all the names of all the tests! In England , if you go into hospital you're lucky if they tell you your doctor's name! Also, we must be the only country where no-one is told their blood group - and they get upset if you ask!
Anyway, Mum 90, multiple health problems, heart, lungs etc. Has regular transfusions. Was due one today. Has been getting weaker each day. 10 days ago, hb 11.5. Last night she was in a terrible state. Could hardly breathe and was hanging on to me in excrutiating pain all over her body. Stayed with her all night, eventually slept.
Today, hb was 8.2. She usually goes down about .5 a week.
Stupid English hospital said they had no bed for her to stay to have her second bag of blood (day centre was closing) so we have to go back on Thursday.
Does this sound like  the MDS has crossed to a leukemic state or does the MDS produce these symtoms when the hb is low ? The doctors won't tell me anything - I told you, they're all sworn to secrecy like the Masons!

                In March I discovered a swollen lump about the size of a grape on my left breast.  It is on my aereola next to the nipple.  It is a little red, swollen and warm to the touch.  It somewhat resembles a swollen bug bite.  It does not hurt and is not tender.  About a week before I discovered the lump I found a swollen lump under my left armpit but it went away after a couple of days.  I went to my doctor who thought it was probably mastitis because it was so close to the surface of the skin.  He recommended warm damp compresses on my breast several times a day for two weeks.  He said if it didn't help then I should see a surgeon.  It did not go away so I went to see a general surgeon.  He too thought it may be mastitis or some sort of infection and tried me on a bout of strong antibiotics for a week.  The antibiotics didn't work either so he did a punch biopsy of the lump and was told to come back in a week for the results.  On Monday I went in to see him for the results and was told that they think it may be Lymphoma but they still are not 100% certain.  He said they are wanting to send it off and run more tests on the sample.  He said it still could come back as a very resistant infection but to be prepared as it may not.  He informed he that he was putting me on their ""cancer board"" where other cancer specialists and pathologists will discuss my case.  He also said he was basically stumped because this is not breast cancer but it is presenting on the breast.  He said he has never seen this before.  Has anyone heard of lymphoma presenting on the breast?  From what I have read lymphoma is not easy to diagnose.  If this does come back as lymphoma, how certain can they be that the diagnoses is right?  Is there a lot of room for error?   Should I get a second opinion?

                I have struggled with anemia and fatigue over the past few years.  I've had my blood tested a number of times and am wondering if the trends are reason to be concerned.  My WBC has gone from 6.8 to 5.7 to 5.3 over the past 5 years.  Likewise, my other tests have done the following:
RBC	4.75	4.34	3.89

Plt	223	217            186

Neut	68	63.8	58

and my lymphocytes have increased from 22 to 29.2 to  36.5

I am concerned about Hairy Cell Leukemia but don't want to tell my doctor's what to do. 

Thanks for any thoughts.

                Back in September of 2009 my husband presented with an ear infection that would not respond to intervention with antibiotics. Shortly after that he developed a growth of his testis which the doctor treated as an infection as well. After that he started presenting problems with urination and passing semen when trying to urinate. All the while he has continously presented some form of infection. Two months ago he had an episode that suggested a TIA. He was out of the country. He was seen in an emergency room but did not have any tests done beyond a CBC. At the time his WBC and neutrophils were high and his lymphocytes and monocytes were low. He complains of tiredness constantly, back pain and head ache. His doctor sent him for a body scan which revealed changes of sponylosis in his spine and a mass or in doctors tern ""extra axial CSF collection in cerebellum"" His most recent blood work shows traces of blood in the urine, abnormal  UWBC, URBC high CRP. Could he have multiple myeloma? Since all of this started he has lost about 26 pounds

                Ok I have a story to tell and then I have a few question.  My 29 year old daughter discovered that she had severe anemia back in Feb.  The doc thought it was due to a 5 year old gastric bypass surgery and an iron defiency.  He inserted a port, and started IV iron infusions.  After several she had a really bad reaction.  They tried again, and once again she has a horrible reaction.  Pain in chest, shortness of breath, headache.......  While being hospitalized twice for this they did 2 non contrasts catscan of her brain and said all was well. The doc then said she was allergic to iron. Moving on.... She changed doc and found that she had a small ulcer in her pouch and that she had, had a slow bleed due to excessive motrin use.  While seeing this new hemotologist/oncologist, she told him about a lymph in her neck that had been swollen for about 5 months.  (she has Epstein Barr and her level had been elevated)
He did an MRI with contrast, no other test and told her she Hodgkins Lymphoma.  First question, can you determind Hodgkins without any type of biopsy?   She has an appointment with him several weeks later, to discuss options for treatments.   She then tells him about these headaches that she has been having.  He orders and MRI with contrast and an MRI without, he ordered a sonagram of her salvatary gland and thyroid. ( In the middle of all of this she had a severe abscessed tooth which required extracting 2 reg and a widsom.)  By the way all of this has been on her left side.   
The sonagram comes back negative.  The MRI of her brain cames back, white matter changes, toxic metabolic change, and aniomas.  All on the left side.  Her headache is on the right.  
The sonagram of her other glands looked good.

She has to her IV port (on left)  on Wed, due to an small tumor of neves forming around it and causing her great pain.

She saw a neurologist and he wants to do an MRI of her spine to see if there is any Lymphoma in her spine then he wants to do a spinal to see what the toxic metabloic changes are.   
Her oncologist finally ordered a pet scan due to the neurologist suggesting it.  That will be done on Tuesday of this week.  I am just searching for answers here.

My next questions are:    Do you think this sounds like lymphonma of the brain?
                                     Do you think any of these other issues may be playing a part in any of this?
                                     As asked earlier, can you dignosis Hodgkins without a biospy?

My mind is just boggled by all of this. 
                                     Would the earlier CT scans without contast have showed any of this? 
                                      Could the port, and teeth be causing any of this?

                in march i had tonsilitis. swollen gland with white patches on my throat. was cleared up with antibiotics. 
in april i had 2 moles removed from my neck.
a few days after i was rubbing a stiff neck and felt a swollen cervical lymph node on the right side of my neck. apon further investigation i felt the similar node on the right side. when i pressed on it it hurt but it was not that large at all. maybe the size of a small  kidney bean or marble. 
i went to the dr and he wasnt worried at all. i went back 2 weeks later and he still wasnt worried. i went back a few days later and saw his partner who also was not worried. 
i went to the ENT who sent a camera up my nose and saw i had large adenoids. not an issue he said.
he was not concerned withthe cervical lymph nodes either. he gave me antibiotics and i have an appointment in7 days for a follow up.
only when i press on them they hurt. they have not grown...well, when i play with them they tend to get a little bigger.
Is there something i need to worry about? can it be something and none of the drs have caught it? I am just wondering what could have caused these thigns to swell.
any input would be welcomed.
just keep the negative stuff out please. thanks
I have no symptoms of anythign else. i feel great, i exercise and have no loss of appetite at all!

Age: 41 Years 
Sex: Male 
Height: 5' 8"" 
Weight: 77 Kgs 
I have been living with High Platelet count since few years. 4 Years before, 1st time I did CBC the count was 584. Since then I have done CBC about 8-9 times. It is varying between 480-600. All this time all Hematologists where 
I did this test told me no need for medication as I dont have any symptoms. So need not worry. 
Recently I have moved to China, where Doctors are not that smart. 
Last month I did the Test twice.. once it was 622 Count. So my new General Phyiscian suggested another test through another lab within 10 days . The result was PLT 677. 
My other results are normal like WBC, RBC and Homoglobin. 
My doctor is suggesting to start on low dose of 80mg Aspirin to prevent clotting for 3 months. Is he right ? 
Is it necessary bcse in last 4 years the count has been varying between 480-600 ?? If I start taking low 
dose Aspirin,  Will I have to take it for resf of my whole life ?? I want to avoid this tablet for this treatment bcse of the side effects. Also I have read in various websites that Aspirin does not bring down the platelet count. 
Kindly Advise what should I do ? Should I consult some good Hematologist before I start medication of low dose 
Aspirin ??

                My daughter (age 27) has been on prevacid for quiet some time for indigestion. She had lunch a few days ago and about an hour later began to have diarrhea and vomiting every 10 to 15 minutes for about 6 to 7 hrs accompanied with severe pain on her right side, under her ribs.  She spent several hours in an ER and after blood test, ultrasound, iv and medications she was told that everything was fine but to follow up with her doctor the next day.  She did this and had more blood test done as well as an hidascan of her gall bladder.  She was told that the blood test for ulcers were negative as well as the scan was negative on the gall bladder. However, when the scan was started the sphincter muscle didn't want to relax for the dye to go thru to the gall bladder.  She has tried to eat light foods such as broth, baked potatoe with no butter, etc.  Each time she eats or drinks, it either comes right back up or out the other end.  She doesn't seem to be having the pain like she was.  
What do you suggest.

Dr thought it was a bone marrow issue.  He was given IV antibiotics which brought his wbc down, yet not his inflamation or anything else.  It looks a lot like JRA (arthritis).  One set of DR's wanted further testing to rule out Leukemia, while another DR said there was no way with elevated platelets.  Seeing a Rheumetologist, hoping they have answers.  Just looking for helpful feedback.  Sounds a lot like JRA, just would like to know what is affecting my little guy so much!

                In September of 2009, I had been experiencing some strange symptoms (night sweats, high grade fever (103), foamy urine with dark tint, sore throat, cold sweats, the shakes, itchy hands and feet, swollen lymph nodes etc.) It took a week before I was finally told I had mononucleosis. My liver tests were apparently off the charts and my spleen was swollen. The doctor put me on prednisone and eventually I recovered.

After a while, everything as far as blood work returned to normal, but since then I have still from time to time experienced itchy hands and feet as though it seems I can't pinpoint where I am itching. It doesn't feel like a normal itch. I'm also still experiencing foamy urine with a strange tint, although it is no longer dark, and I wake up some mornings with backed up green phlegm in my throat and slightly swollen tonsils (or tonsil?). I also have what seems like a bad case of post-nasal drip. The lymph nodes are also still swollen, although it is not noticeable unless I touch it.

Some things I have not experienced in these eight months however is fatigue, any low grade fevers since the diagnosis, weight loss, night sweats, and the itchiness seems to have calmed down quite a bit as well. What has increased however is the sore throat and what seems like the swelling of the tonsil. I also have OCD and constantly have anxiety about my health, so I'm scared to go in and get a biopsy and my doctor insists that I am fine. I don't feel ill, but the sore throat and swollen lymph nodes and tonsil are bothering me quite a bit. The lymph node has not increased in size and I haven't found any other swollen lymph nodes.

                I am a 22 year old male and have had swollen lymph nodes for the past 6-8 months. About 8 months ago I saw a doctor regarding this issue and was diagnosed with Lymphadenopathy. (I was tested for STDs and came up negative) I was given antibiotics and anti inflammatories and the swelling went down until about a month later when I noticed my inguinal lymph node on the right side was swollen again. It has been swollen since, and now the left side is also beginning to swell a little. I have had the same girlfriend for four years and I was tested for STDs and came up negative so i now its not herpes or HIV. As for a brief medical history.. My mother has SLE Lupus, and about two and a half years ago I had my appendix removed with no complications and I have no other medical issues. I am a college student and unfortunatley cannot afford health insurance so I have not been able to see a doctor. Is this something serious, could it be Lymphoma? 

Thank You for your time..

                I have been experiencing some weird symptoms lately and am wondering what it could be.

A few months ago, I got a tonsil infection that did not respond to antibiotics and took about 2 weeks to go away on its own.  

For the last two months I have had a cough that won't quite go away.  Also over the last month, I have had 5-6 canker sores, which I occasionally get but never that often.  Finally, this week, I noticed I had a some white spots on the side of my tongue that could be either oral thrush or hairy leukoplakia.  

With all these infections, I'm wondering if I might have leukemia.  

The doctor gave me a z-pack for the cough and an antifungal for the spots on my tongue.  He didn't seem concerned but sent me for blood work just in case. 

How concerned should I be?

                My father has recently finished up chemotherapy and radiation for cancer found in his lymph nodes in his throat. Due to the radiation on his throat, it became extremely difficult for him to eat, and a feeding tube was put in to help him maintain his weight. Now that he is done with treatment, the feeding tube will come out but he is still having problems with eating due to the lack of saliva. His doctor basically told him he would have to deal with this for about 6 months. I was wondering if anyone knew of any ideas to help him, other that to eat wet food, or to drink water with each bite.

i have tried to see what ones they are but i cannot figure out of they are post aurical or posterial cervical nodes. has anone had these before? im freaking out cause i dont like having swollen glands in the neck . i keep touching it to see if it goes away but its still there. i turn my head one way and it isnt there but i turn it another way and it feels bigger. im starting to freak myself out. its been about 10 days that i felt it. how long do they take to go back to normal size? i have no fever, no vomiting and no night sweats. aside from the lymph node and sheer anxiety i feel fine.

I had a third ventriculostomy for a benign brain tumor a few years ago and I've recently been diagnosed with lupus. For over a year now, I've dealt with chronic fatigue and illness and I've tested positive for epstein barr virus multiple times. Initially, my doctor diagnosed this as chronic mono, but now he's questioning if my EBV is actually mono or if it its one of the forms of cancer associated with EBV. The strange thing is that my levels of mono keep growing but no one I've been in contact with has ever contacted any symptoms of it. I've looked into this, and the only issue that seems relevant is a large lump directly underneath my chin that's been present for months. Could this be a sign of nazopharyngeal carcinoma or is it simply a swollen gland?

                Hi all,

my daughter is a very happy and active 19-month old baby.
Last week friday she get out of bed and suddenly limps on her left leg. She doensn't seem to have any pain when you touch her foot / leg but when she walks she limps. There aren't any other symptoms. We went to the pediatrician last tuesday who thought about water in the hip but an echo today confirmed that there is no water in the hip. 
I have a new appointment on monday with her doctor but googling around made me start worry about leukemia. However, besides the limping there are not any other signs for this (eats good, doesn't look pale, no fever, not bleeding, no bruises (besides one on her knee but that is from falling I think)). 
Any advice?

                I am an 18 year old female and for the past two weeks I've just been feeling...off. I don't feel sick like the typical stuffy/runny nose, cough, etc. but three weeks ago I finally was able to stop taking Zoloft, my antidepression med and for a week I was doing great. Then suddenly after that week I couldn't sleep. I was deathly afraid that if I fell asleep I wouldn't wake up again. I went to the nurse after two days of this and they attributed it to anxiety and a unique symptom from being off the meds. So when I started to get some sleep three days later the tension headaches started...It felt like my head was in a vise grip for five days after that, along with this sharp pain in my temple and ears. They said that was ALSO probably due to anxiety/stress from being off the med or TMJ, so I was advised to keep taking my Wellbutrin and Xanex if I needed it (I only took it four or five times within two weeks). This past weekend my tension headaches started to ease up but then my jaw hinges were in excruciating pain. That went away and now the area under my chin and jaw is aching and feels swollen all of a sudden. For the past week I've also been experiencing weakness in my right leg and fatigue. Sometimes I feel lightheaded and panicky because I don't know what's wrong with me. Is my pain traveling down my head and neck? What could this be from? I've been doing some research and I thought maybe I had Lymphoma but I honestly have no idea what is going on anymore and I'm scared.
I should also note that I have not had my period in three months and while I'm usually irregular, this is starting to worry me (and there's no possible way I'm pregnant since I am not and have never been sexually active). I'm in school and have no access to a clinic or my doctor and I'm not sure how much a school nurse can do for me. 
Any advice/suggestions/ideas would be much appreciated :(

                Hello,  I have a few questions.  I've been having concerning symptoms since 2007.  Then I had a remission of symptoms for about a year and a half and fell sick again last March (a year ago).  This go round my symptoms started as weakness, fatigue,dizziness,brain fog, and pinsneedles/numbness in feet.  They checked me for MS and MRI's have all been normal as well as spinal tap.  I was then diagnosed with Lyme Disease and have been treating since last July. Many of my symptoms have got better, but I've deveoped new ones.  I now have pain (joints, muscle, and nerve) I notice I've been brusing REALLY bad and get baseball size bruises out of nowhere. Some of my dr's are now doubting the lyme diagnosis cause I'm not better yet.

 I've recently seen an immunolgist because some of my blood work has been abnormal.  My CD56 and 57 are very low, by NK+ are very low, and my B cells are very low.  I know at one point they mentioned that I may need a bone marrow biopsy to see if it is a malignancy.  But I haven't had one yet.  

I'm a little worried, as I know some of my symptoms fit Leukemia and my messed up blood work concerns me.

Please, anyone with any advice..

                last week i had 2 moles removed. 1 waw right under my chin on my neck and the other was on the left side of my neck.as i was washing myhair the next night i felt a lymph node onthe  right side of my neck behind my ear below my hair line. i went to the dr today cause i was a little concerned. he said that it could have reacted to the mole being removed and to not touch it.
i know these lymph nodes are the ones that are swollen due to local infection,but has anyone gone through this/? it is not really nig at all, just that i can feel it i can feel its twin on the left side as well. my allegies have been a little crazy as well so  i thought it was them too. the lump  does not hurt and it is not hard at all.

                Hi and thanks for reading.  I am not currently diagnosed with leukemia but I was unsure where to ask my leukemia related question..  

For the past 4-5 months I have been experiencing a wide range of symptoms which first appeared as vision blurring and abnormalities (december), then balance/coordination issues (january), and finally neck/back joint pains which are excruciatingly painful (past few months). 

I just had a blood test done which revealed several abnormalities.  I had Vitamin D deficiency (25-OH D level at just 13!! D2 at 13, D3 <4. normal range is 20-100)  high eosinophils (5.4, normal is 0-4) and low Anion Gap (6, normal is 7-15).   Does anyone have any ideas what could cause my symptoms with this blood analysis result?  I was also negative for parasites in a stool test (apparently often related to eosinophils).  My doctor was about to prescribe me vitamin d supplements but I asked him to do a full D panel to see if the active vitamin d (1,25) is high (which I read means that there is a disease process going on).   

I have a return appointment to discuss that in a few weeks but I feel there is truly more that needs to be tested.  Specific concerns are blood diseases associated with Eosinophils, including its several forms (though rare) of leukemia, and also autoimmune diseases (such as ms). Does anyone have any ideas what could relate to my blood results and symptoms?  What should I ask for to be tested next to discover the cause of all this?  I am 99.999999% certain the cause of my ailments is not that i am simply Vit.D deficient. 

thanks in advance

                My dad had colon cancer about 2 years ago, ten months ago he had 2 units of blood for low blood volume. I have lived and cared for him for 8 months and last week he became pale, weak, and lost his appetite.within a day and a half he became grayish yellow and was taken to the ER. he was severely anemic.After 4 pints of Blood and many test they said that his platlets were low and his spleen was enlarged. They also found a mass in his abdomen but did nothing about that yet. he underwent many tests, ct scan, upper gi, and colonoscopy , they removed polups  from his esophagus and sent them for biopsy.no bleed was found. after 5 days at the hospital his Doc told me sometimes enough was enough. He has refered my dad to an Oncologist, haemotologist and stated that he believed that he had leukemia. My dad is 76 and seems to be still very weak since he returned home. What is the prognosis of someone with advanced age and these symptoms? I dont know what I can expect and would like to know how advanced is it when your spleen is affected, any answers would be helpful?

                I am looking for any help, direction,advice, or guidance before I truly lose my mind and spend more hard-earned money on medical testing....
I am a 30 yr. old mother of two. Since August '09 I have been consistently losing weight and currently have lost 35 pounds. My family dr. has given reasons from stress, to starvation, to shingles........I have have repeated blood work, urinalysis, stool samples for parasites, occult blood, and fat absorption, an abdominal ultrasound, abdominal and pelvic CT, and an upper GI. So far everything has been ""prisitine"" as the doctors have said.....I am most likely going to be undergoing a colonoscopy and endoscopy within the next month-hopefully not un-necessarily. My syptoms have been the following;
weight loss, left sided abdominal soreness and pain from ""spleen"" area wrapping around to back, difficulty sitting in bed due to this discomfort, ""sludgy"" stools since August, more recently dry mouth, headaches, i tend to feel full quickly or have very little appetite at times, I have noticed some minimal vision changes and mental confusion(only apparent to me so far). 
I really don't believe this is GI related, but don't know what it could be (a lymphoma?) and truly have no idea which direction to turn in.......Please help!

                 Hi,
I hope someone can help me. 

It all started beginning of March. Tiredness, and low energy. Middle of March aches and pains in shoulders, upper arms, and right side of back of neck. I can not find any lymph nodes that would be worrisome. What I do have are a pea size lymph nodes here or there..that when pressed is extremely painful. Then next day I will check same place and that is gone. The aches , and pains have gotten better since for 5 days now. But I have now have for the last 3 days is a low grade fever, with chills in the late afternoon it starts. It ranges about 99.4, 99.6. I have a low body temp. usually so I really feel it. But it fluctuates wildly. 20 mins low grade, next hour fine , next 5 mins low grade, 2 hours fine. It is that crazy. CBC was fine, and Sed Rate, and  LDH test, which were normal. 

Does any of this send a red flag to you? Thank you for any help.

user_1274904,SickandTired21,/posts/Leukemia-and-Lymphoma-/Fever-for-over-a-year/show/1215311,Fever for over a year!,"
                For the past year I have had non stop low grade fevers (normally between 99.2-100.0, but it is not uncommon for it to hit 101.0) I have had 

problems sleeping, pain in my arms and legs, my muscles are easily exhausted (I was in great athletic shape, even won a few national medals)

CONDITIONS:
21 y.o. Female, no kids, no drugs or alcohol, do smoke (1pk/every 3 days)

Endometriosis (w/ bowel & Bladder involvement)

Fibromyalgia (supposedly. Was dx'd after all this started for the body pain)

SVT (Was on a heart monitor when I was 16, didnt catch an episode, in the last month I have had numerous episodes and one trip to the E.R. 

for an episode lasting longer than 24hrs, this was the first time it happened that I can remember)

MEDICATIONS:
Necon (birth control, taken for suppression continously for 5 years)
Morphine Sulfate (taken for endometriosis pain continuously, started early last year)
Cymbalta (taken for Fibromyalgia, started in September)
Flexeril (taken to aid in sleep for Fibromyalgia, started in September)

Please excuse some redundancies, I have a jobbled mind right now, and quite frankly feel very ill.
I will start from the beginning and will include labs later. 

I was vacationing in Key West, FL and woke up the morning after we got there with brown urine. I also started to get the dreaded cramping from 

endometriosis. After going to the bathroom I stood up and a sharp pain in my abdomen threw me forward and I was on my way to the E.R. 

(There was no meunstral blood in my urine, the urine came out brown (no red) and the bleeding started after the E.R visit) I also did not have a 

sunburn, we had gotten there the night before. 

I also felt very weak and tired, but sleeping just wasn't helping, didn't feel like I had actually fallen asleep, more like stuck in the 2 REM right 

before deep sleep (a very weird feeling) but I have also been known to sleep for 18 hours (or even more, sometimes 24hrs) since I was about 15.

After the trip to Florida, I traveled with my boyfriend (who works touring). I flew from Ft. Lauderdale to Cleveland,OH and drove up to Detroit, then 

all the way to New Orleans, then all the way to Los Angeles and then to Vegas. 

Half way through Texas I got pain in my arms (deep, pulsating pain up and down them) rubbing didn't help but a really hot bath did (for the 

moment) then it was back to pain. (I also have had random tingling in my fingers and toes for about 2 years). 

After this started I started to get very weak and tired, hot, sweaty, dizzy and the random stabbing pains in my stomache (which would hit for a 

second, then go away)

This continued for a few months, and about 6 months ago I started to get deep pains where my appendix is along with nausea (no vomiting), 

between that and the fever I went to the E.R. They told me I probably had appendicitis and wouldn't be going home (to Oregon, I was in FL) and 

that I would probably have surgery. I had a CT and it showed nothing. I had a pelvic done and the best they could come up with was that I had a 

bad UTI (I've had them before, and even a kidney infection, this didn't feel like that at all) So I was put on Levaquin and sent home. 

I went home for Thanksgiving and had very soft stools, not diahrea, but just soft and persistant stools. I took immodium like crazy to slow it 

down and it did not. 

I noticed a very small pointed bump where the front of my neck and chin meet, (felt like a small upsidown hershey kiss) and I had pain running 

through my neck. That finally went away.

After that finally started to clear up I got random bouts of nausea and vomiting. I would be fine one minute and puking the next.

I developed a large swollen, red, painful lymph node on my left side in my armpit, went away after 36hrs (was checked and confirmed by a 

doctor)

I went to 2 Gynecologists (my regular, and a new one) and both had no clue. 

I started getting bad constipation. I took stimulate laxatives and it didnt do ANYTHING. I took miralax, then finally did 3 enemas and it all came 

out. I have had a few bad episodes since.

I went to a GI doctor, had a stool test to rule out C. Diff (as I have been on a gamut of antibiotics in the last year) had a colonoscopy and upper 

endoscopy, looked normal and they took a sample on my small intestine, which was normal. The random sharp pains stopped after the 

colonoscopy.


I saw a Rheumatologist who ran tests for Lymes, Rheumatoid Arthritis, Lupus and a head MRI for MS, all negative, but my ANA was borderline 

(Normal between 1-40, I was 40). I was Dx'd with Fibromyalgia.

I started taking my temperature religiously, even buying 3 different types of thermometers, I had fevers 99% of the day. 

In all this time I would have dizzyness, heart pounding, hot, shaky when standing.

I would also have a strange feeling when sleeping on my back, felt like someone was pushing on my chest.

I woke up one morning and my heart was racing (normally laying down will make it stop) but this time nothing I did helped (my mother has SVT, 

I tried the vagal maneuvers). Eventually I knew something wasn't right, I was shaky and confused. I drove to the hospital and I was immediately 

diagnosed as having an SVT. I almost had my heart stopped (with adnesine (sp?) but I started crying because I was scared, and that lowered 

my heart rate!!!! I should also note that my body didnt feel so crummy on the IV fluids, it lowered my temperature.

After all of this, my Rheumatologist sent me to an Infectious Disease doctor for the fevers.
I had many blood tests and I have had all together 4 episodes of the swollen, painful lymph nodes, all on the right side in the armpit, but in 

different spots each time. Yesturday I developed one in my right armpit, but it is to small to be biopsied. 

They have ruled out:
MS
Lymes
Lupus (but still a suspect)
RA
Cat Scratch Disease (bartonella)
Q Fever
coccidiosis (san joaquin valley fever)
Syphilis
HIV 1&2
Mono

I should also mention I have had frequent infections since I was 14. I had muliple strep throats that turned into abcesses (had my tonsils 

removed). Bladder infections, ear infections, 5 bouts of MRSA (in right armpit). 2 random abcesses in right armpit that had to be cut and 

drained. Sinus infections, everything. I have developed allergies to all antibiotics except quinalones and azythramycin. 
I feel like road kill and I am finding it extremely difficult to take care of myself, to bathe, to get to the restroom.

I had a mammogram & ultrasound on my left armpit the last time my lymph node swelled up, only showed inflammed lymph nodes.

Now the Infectious disease doctor is testing for sarcoidosis.

LABS:
These are just from the Infectious disease doctor, excluding the ones I had done today for sarcoidosis (plus I have a CT of chest, abdomen and pelvis on Tuesday)

(((SEE NEXT POST FOR LABS))

The doctor has diagnosed me with Lymphadenopathy and Lymphocytosis, I am having a CT done in less than a week. I seriously cannot take this any longer. I break down every few weeks from just pushing myself to do normal things. I feel like I ran a marathon and that every little thing is another marathon. Any suggestions would make the world of difference to me right now.

                I've got swollen Lymph nodes in both sides of my groin, not HIV, i was worried but have had multiple tests. 

About 18 months ago, at first i started to notice an uncomfortable feeling in my right side of my groin which would only appear if i had been out drinking the night before, but the following day this would go away, this happened for about 3 months and gradually the pain became permanent. 

Went for an ultrasound scan and it detected 2 enlarged nodes. The 6 months following the scan they generally fluctuated in pain. Then for the previous 4 months the uncomfortable feeling has increased, then about 2 months ago i started to feel the same feeling in my left side too, gradually increasing in pain. 

Went for a second ultrasound and now i have 2 swollen on my left side as well. I also feel a kind of pins and needles sensation (a little itchy) all the way across my stomach from one side to the other and feel uncomfortable on my inner thighs too. They have become large now and i feel uncomfortable just sitting down. Have been to see a doctor many times and they just tell me that some people are susceptible to getting these, but the pain and spread is slowly getting larger, im really worried. Any help would be much appreciated

                Hi,
my son is 2 and he has been sick pretty much since he was born. We just went to infectious disease doctor today and did not get many answers. I have to wait a week for blood test results. She said we would start at auto immune diseases and limit things out. My son has had a high sed rate of 73 up to 80 just about every time his blood has been taken this year. He is sick about once a week with vomiting and fever. Hes anemic and his WBC is usually high but does come down after he seems to be getting better but the sed rate is always high. He has been hospitalized twice this year and noone ever gives us answers besides says its adnoid virus. He has had strep recurring and this adnoid virus for the last 3 months. He finally got over the strep. My question is with this sed rate being so high is it possible that they might test for cancer? Whats sed rates do young children usually have with cancer? I am very concerned because he does not sleep good at night and wakes up screaming in paun about every couple of hours. He will scream for a little bit and then Ill calm him down he will go back to sleep. Then, do it again several hours later. I do have lupus run in my family so they are doing ANA test to see about that but I just want to make sure Im not missing anything.

                About one month ago I found a lump on my neck which was diagnosed as a swollen lymph node. My only other ""symptom"" was some minor acne on my face & neck. My doctor's PA prescribed an antibiotic to clear the acne & any other possible infection that might be causing the gland to swell. The acne was clear for about 2 weeks, but began to reappear when my prescription was finished. 
When I went for my follow up visit with the PA she agreed that there was no change to the lymph node, so she prescribed another round of antibiotics. Obviously I'm not a doctor, but this makes no sense to me.... ""Let's try some antibiotics. Oh, that didn't work? OK, let's try again."" Isn't that the definition of insanity - doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results?

We went back to the regular Doctor just a couple of weeks ago...I complained that my son still is getting tired easily, and often times for no reason will turn pale and flushed...this time ti Dr. had a cat scan done - it showed an enlarged spleen, enlarged nodes in his abdomen, and ""lipomas"" in the lining of his stomach. 

The Dr..and the hematologist had lab work ran again...a CBC, a Uric Acid, LDH, and a BCrabso (?) - the CBC showed lower than normal red cell, and MPV counts...the Uric Acid came back fine, and the LDH came back 796 - we're still waiting for the other test which I think is one to check for genetic markers ........

Needless to say mom here is FREAKING out - am I paranoid to think there is a cancer going on?? 

He has days where he is fine....days then where he is tired...and then days where someone coughs, he is sick........

Any guidance will be beneficial....we live in a small rural community 80plus miles from a major medical center.

                I am 2 months post radiation and chemo for Diffuse Large B Cell Non-Hodkin Lymphoma--stage two, one lymph node in neck and back of tongue involved. Chemo ended 11/09, PET scan clear 12/09, radiation ended 1/10.  I feel great and am wanting to return to normal life. The man I am with and I enjoy somewhat kinkier sex, spankings, and such and he is worried it can cause a recurrence in my cancer. Does anyone have any experience here? I could ask my oncologist, but he is pretty straight laced! Thanks for the help.

                My friend has what appears to be a lump right above the cephalic vein on his forearm near some nerve clusters where a lymph node is. He has also been experiencing muscle tics all over his body. I know tics are not a symptom of Lymphoma but if it is a swollen lymph node near nerve clusters that could be causing the tics. Should he get the lump checked out?

                Hi, I have been having a bit of upper abdominal pain for a couple of weeks but didn't make much of it. I went to the doctor to have some routine blood tests done. Before I got the blood work done, the abdominal pain started to be be there more often and its often when I'm sitting down and not standing up and it radiates to my back and I have a little difficulty breathing. The pain is hard to describe, it's like a heavy/stabbing feeling but it's not painful. I've gotten the abdominal pain on both sides. If I sleep on my right side, the next day I'll wake up and have the pain in my right side ect. If I lean to one side while sitting, I'll have the pain on that side. I had my gall bladder taken out about 5 years ago because of gallstones. Some other things.. I have had this enlarged lymp node in under my chin for about a month now. But I have had the flu two separate times in the past month. This lymph node was also swollen a year ago when I had a cold but it wasn't there after a while. I have put on about 20 pounds in the past few months. No nausea, vomitting, good appetite. I'm an 18 year old male.

I did my blood tests and my results sort of worried me.
Lymph: 55.1 (Range: 10-50)
Lymp Total: 3.7 (Range: 0.6-3.4)
Plyseg Neutrophil: 33.6 (Range: 37-80)
Neut / Precr total #: 2.3 (Range: 2.0-6.9)
WBC count is normal

Liver/kidney functions came back normal and urinealysis came back good as well.

Thanks.

                Hi,

I have had swolen lymph nodes in my groin area for about 6 months. About 3 months ago I got swollen lymph nodes under my arms, large, around my neck and under my collar bone, both sides and above my elbows, about 4 glands each side above my elbows. I now have a rash on my forehead and sometimes on my arms, which when I scratch turn bright red, like I could scratch my name in. I have a bright red rash around my neck which disappears when i touch it and reappears brighter after. After a shower it is bright red. Could this be lymphoma??

Many thanks

                Dear Dr. Pho,
I am Vincent Van Der Weerden a 20 year old university student in Florida, who for the past 2-3 weeks has been having abnormal bowel movements usually 2-3 times a day. The problem is not disabling, but it is somewhat worrysome. The worrysome part is that there is sometimes mucus present in my bowel movements. The bowel movements change in appearance and consistency, sometimes there watery, solid, stringy you name it. The mucus part is what worries me. I should note that i was in Nicaragua back in January and got a parasite there. I recovered but when i returned home i was sick again because my stomach was not used to the food. I recivered form that, was fine for 2 weeks and then this problem. The good news is that i never had any bleeding and my appetite is still good. I am going to see a specialist in 2 weeks during spring break, but i just wanted your opinion on this. I did do blood tests to check my sedimentation rate, but that was fine and my feces were negative for parasites. So my blood test indicates there is no inflamation present, but i am still not sure. I am undecided if i have IBS or colitis. Maybe you can help me with your advice. Is 2 bowel movements a day with some mucus but no blood a symptom of IBS or colitis? I should note that i also have clear anal discharge

                Hello. . .
I'm nineteen years old and several months ago I woke up with a headache and a big swollen, painful ball at the base of my head  on the left side of the back of my neck. A week later I caught a severe case of mono. I've come to notice more lymph nodes since then: A significant one in my leg and a tiny one near my pelvic area. I don''t know if I have reason to be scared but I am very confused. The lymph node in my neck doesn't hurt all the time, just occasionally. But when it does hurt it's bothersome and takes a while to stop. I went for a checkup and I was told it's a posterior lymph node thing?? I don't know. But if anyone can tell me anything about this at all. . . It would be very much appreciated.

                My 20 year old sister was recently diagnosed with Hodgkins Lymphoma.  I'm concerned because the lump appeared around 11 months ago. 

Last December, my sister noticed a small lump forming on her neck.  She immediately pointed it out to my mom.  We also noticed that she had gone from a healthy 116 pounds to around 90-95 (my sister said it was from living in NYC).  Nothing was done about it, and the lump slowly grew.  As the lump slowly grew, she started to complain about a pain in her arm.  After a few months, the lump was growing larger, I knew something was very wrong.  I begged my sister constantly to let me take her to a Doctor, since my mom wasn't going to do anything about it.  She refused.  I asked my mom many times to please take her, but she never did.  More time passed, and the lump grew larger still, while a new lump was forming right next to it.  During this time, the pain in her arm grew worse.  It got to the point where the first lump was quite large and very noticeable.  Another lump was quickly growing in the same spot on the opposite side of her neck.  At this point, the pain in her arm was so severe, she couldn't sleep.  My mom finally decided to take her to a Doctor.

So here we were, one week ago.  After blood work, and a CT scan, she was given the diagnosis of Hodgkins.  She is meeting with a surgeon on Tuesday.  Unfortunately, from what I can gather, the CT scan showed a large spot where her largest lump is, a small spot where the new lump formed, and spots all throughout her chest.  My sister is very tired, can't eat much, and vomits often.  I feel like we really need to speed things up here, in terms of treatment.    

Please, at this point, any advice is welcome.  I don't know what her chances are, and i'm just looking for some opinions.  I am trying to stay positive, but it is very hard sometimes.  I have no one to talk to about this either, which makes it even harder.  I wish I could do more for her.

                okay im 15 years old and last week on thursday i was rubbing my neck and found a pea sized lump in my neck thats rubbery in texture, but i can move it i think. then just last night i was feeling my neck, because my doctor told me to keep track of the lump and if anything changed to tell him and he would look and do a biopsy. while feeling my neck right under my jaw line i found a lump about the size of a golf ball, well a little smaller then one. they don't hurt to touch but if i keep on feeling my neck, my neck will start to become swollen and tender.
i have also been experiencing symptoms like:

- swollen tonsils, even though my throat doesn't hurt.
- nausea *very severe at night time before bed*
- i also get really hot at night, but i don't sweat.
- horrible headaches that last a couple hours, and sometimes don't go away at all.
- really exhausted all the time 
- i usually sleep right after school for about 2-3 hours 
- i have been coughing but not that much.   

family history- finally i have family history of lymphoma. my aunt had it when she was my age (she is 33 and now cancer free) My mom was the one who took her to the sick kids hospital and the doctors told her that if she didn't come in when she did my aunt would have died in a month. So for these reasons i am quite scared :( please help if you can.

                In need of answers, I've had a fixed hard swollen lymph node on the left side of my neck for about 3yrs, I have just been going through ultrasounds, I've had 4 ultrasounds already now I have 2 under each arms, 2 under the chin that are swollen which I was not aware of I am not sure how long they have been swollen for I've also had night sweats, I lost 10lbs then I gain 2 or 3 lbs then I go back down, I was at 130lbs now I am 120lbs, I usually go up about 2 to 3 lbs then I lose it, I am trying to gain my weight back but the moment I do gain 2-3 lbs & then I lose it! I've had my uterus removed several years ago since it had dropped & was very large, I was given a shot of Lupron to shrink it a month before the operation, I do still have my ovaries, I thought I was getting night sweats because I was hitting menapause, I'm 41yrs od age...I've been told by 2 physicians that it seems that I am dealing with Lymphoma, no further testings have been done at the moment all I know is that my lymph nodes are still the same size, they haven't shrunk nor have they gotten any bigger, the one on the left side of my neck is hard & fixed, the other ones I don't really see them to be honest with all of you, no pain in any of them but the 4 ultrasounds that have been done between Dec 2009/ Feb 2010 shows different...I was going in for a lump on my right breast which was just a cyst this is when the technician spotted the ones under my right arm, then back for more ultrsounds this is when they found the other swollen ones...I am now seeing an internalist which he also sent me for an ultrasound which showed the same results 2 under each arm, one on the left side of my neck & 2 under the chin one on one side one on the other side. I heard that I will need a biopsy on atleast one of them which might be the one on my neck (left side) but still awaiting for my physician to decide...Does it sound like lymphoma? As they say? or might it be something else? Please let me know you're thoughts on this issue, I would truly appreciate any answers..Thank you

It doesn't hurt but it is rubbery and movable. When I compare it to the node on the opposite side it is about 50% to 2x bigger.

I don't have any other symptoms, haven't been ill recently but I have an ever so slightly runny nose but this might be due to the cold weather.

He said that the left one was bigger than the other and that she also had fluid in her left ear as well as a small lymph node behind her ear. He refered us to an ENT doctor and gave us the impression that this could be a malignancy.

                Hello:

Due to an autoimmune liver disease, I am on 150mg of azathioprine (imuran) daily.  This is a high dose.  Leukemia runs in my family, and azathioprine is known to cause leukemia (I've seen several reports on people getting AML).  I've gotten small cherry angiomas all over my body over the past several months, but just recently, I got a petechiae rash on my arm and one on my leg.  I have to have my liver enzymes monitored closely, so I go in for a CBC and liver and metabolic panel of blood tests every month.  My most recent test came back normal - platelets, WBC, etc.,   Potassium level was borderline high.  

My question is is the petechiae caused by some abnormal blood level - low platelets, etc.,, or is there something else that causes it.  Could I be in the initial stages of AML?  I have passed out several times after standing up, and get short of breath whenever I am warm - after bath, when the heater is on, etc.,

Thoughts, comments, etc., would be appreciated.

                I've read that people with recurring EBV infections are at a higher risk of developing Hodgkins disease. Iv'e had HIgh levels of Ebv for years and my doctor has went back and forth about the cause of my low CBC.  Recently in Feb. my Ebv was 5 and my CBC was 2.7 he said the ebv was causing the low cbc. Then in March it was checked again and the ebv was 5 and the cbc was 2.8 now he's saying he's worried about the low cbc. I've had extreme fatigue thats lasted since December, tingling in my left hand witch gets worse when I take a hot shower.  
Other symptoms;
Joint pain
brain fog
dizziness

dry eyes

                I am a 28 yr. old female, married, no children. I do not currently have a diagnosis. However, in Oct. '09 I began having extremely tight muscles, esp. in my legs. I then started having severe muscle twitches all over my body. It got so bad that I started having panic attacks b/c I was so afraid of what it could be. I saw one Dr. that told me I was basically crazy. I then started noticing my muscles would ache in certain spots. Some days it would be so bad that I didn't know if I could walk to my car.  I started to feel hardened, tender spots on my chest, sternum, near shoulders, on inner arms near inner elbows, mid-upper back, groin, butt, and legs. Everywhere.  It felt like my body was burning and so very inflamed. I then saw another Dr. who did blood tests and my C-Reactive protein was very high.  Other than that she couldn't figure anything out other than possible Fibromyalgia.  She referred me to a Rheumatologist that also did a round of blood tests. The blood tests still showed a high C-Reactive protein as of January 2010.  In February I had such a bad ""flare-up"" that I rushed the Rheumatologist office and she did more blood tests. My thyroid levels were somewhat low and the ANA blood test came back positive.  I have since stopped taking my birth control in an effort to see if that was causing my problems. Well, one month later and two missed periods later, I am still having flare-ups.  I am not pregnant.  I take Singulair for asthma daily and Relafan for inflammation. I also had low Vitamin D so I take 2000mg a day of that along with Calcium. 

I am so distraught at this point. My Rheum. wants me to just let it be for the time being. But, I see spots swell on my body and my husband feels the spots and calls them ""knots"".  I don't feel normal and don't know what else to do.  I feel like demanding a CT or an MRI while I'm having these flare-ups. I have noticed that the last two months, my flare-ups have been worsened at the time that I should be having a period. I don't know if that even makes sense. I need help. Any suggestions are welcome. Thank you.

                Hi all,

I discovered two enlarged lymph nodes (bilateral) on my neck about two months ago. I went to see ENT specialist. The CT with contrast came back saying ""There is bilateral cervical adenopathy. The lymph nodes are small in size and I do not see any abnormally enlarged lymph nodes."" & ""There is moderate cervical adenopathy which is nonspecific. This may be reactive adenopathy. There is no evidence for sinusitis or other infection.""

Now I was put on antibiotics by my ENT specialist and need to follow up in about one month. 

My question is when I see the films of the CT by myself, I do see some enlarged lymph nodes. I don't think they are small in size ( how to determine size? long axis? short axis?) 

Is there anything I need to do except taking antibiotics and seeing ENT in one month?

Thanks and take care.

I've been sick w/a high fever, one sided sore throat, swollen face for over a week now.  The dr. initially prescribed antiobiotics, but they did not work so they suspected mono and took blood.  The dr. said the test was positive for mono and that also my liver enzymes were very high and platelet count very low (not life threateningly low, but low).  I was ok with that, but then did some reading and tied in some other symptoms I was having prior to the fever.  I've been having mild trouble swallowing for the last yr or so and if feels like I have something stuck in my throat.  I have had heartburn for the last couple of months.  Also, I run and my chest has felt tight (mildly) while running and I've developed a cough when I run  mainly because I feel like something is stuck in my throat and I'm not getting enough air.  I just discounted those symptoms because they were mild enough and planned on bringing them up at my next yearly physical. However now,  I've never ever felt this sick before in my life.  I just have no energy whatsoever and the fever will not subside.  
I intend to call my dr tomorrow w/questions, but in the meantime I am rather freaked out.  My brother passed away from leukemia 15yrs ago, so I am concerned for myself.

Is it possible to test positive for mono if in fact I have lymphoma?  
What is the likelihood that I never contracted mono before.  I come from a large family (7 kids) and 2 of my brothers had mono when I was growing up.

I'm just really concerned this is something more than mono - am I way off base?

Thank you!

                I've had one for over a year in my neck and have recently discovered two others in my groin and face. Ive had pain getting steadily worse for over a year and frequent illnesses. My doctor has run all the test and up until today my blood work has been clear. Today i was told my white bloods where high and i needed more tests and to go back 'to discuss it' I wouldn't be so freaked out except the lumps are ALL fixed and quite hard and they dont feel like the moveable ones in my neck. All the internet research says that immobile lumps are typically cancer. Im 21 and quite frightened. Is there anything else this could be?

                I went to the doctors with a swollen painful lymph node under my right jaw. She checked me out and was confused because that was the ONLY swollen gland/lymph node. I also had no other symptoms. She took my blood though, and all levels were normal enough. She put me on antibiotics (Augmentin) in case it's bacterial. She also thinks it could be Cat Scratch Fever since I have a cat, but he's been scratching and biting me for almost a year, and he's never had fleas. Anyone have any ideas on what this could be?

                I had a surgery on the 22nd of Feb. My doctor went in and did an excisional biopsy on my left groin lymph nodes. I have a small incision right above my pelvic line. Well it was swollen and painful there, so I didn't bother the area for a few days. Well today I touched the area where I noticed the hard lymph node at first, and it's still there. So now I'm worried that my doctor may have tested the wrong area? I haven't gotten my results yet so I don't no if I should wait to here from him. Or maybe they can test the area around the knot to find what there looking for. I don't want to freak out to bad, but can someone tell me something???

                Hello all,

I had an MRI done (without contrast) to check out some very hard (rock hard) enlarged lymph nodes I felt in my neck.  I have the results right here and have yet to see a doctor.  The results were basically ""cervical lymphadenopathy"" with multiple lymph nodes in posterior triangle of neck and lingular tonsil area.  Should this be concerning?  The sizes range from .5 - over 1 cm.  Could this be a sign of lymphoma?  What tests should be done next?  ANY advice would be welcome.  Thank you.

                Any info or advice for how to proceed?

I don't know that my symptoms indicate cancer, I just don't know where else to post...

***Thank you, in advance, for your help***

Abnormal Lymph Node (non fatty center slightly enlarged) found in R underarm in ultrasound. I was initially seen for swelling and slight tenderness in that same area.  

Mammogram views were clean and after tech did 2 rounds (one 2 weeks ago, one a few days ago) for the area where there is swelling.  Current symptoms are fullness in R breast(it seems bigger than before), slight swelling/tenderness between R breast and armpit.  I have recently started having a shooting pain that goes through my R breast towards the nipple, but perhaps that is hormones and not related? Since December I have noticed that it is very uncomfortable to sleep on my R side.  The underarm, breast and even chest/abdominal area on that R side just feel tender and far more sensitive than I can ever recall.  

I feel a bit silly for making a fuss about this, but I just don't feel quite right. Could this just be a muscle strain?  Is there anything aside from the mammogram/ultrasound that should be checked out?

Went in to MD in late January in regard to swelling between underarm and breast.  There was some minor discomfort initially, but I wouldn't call it ""painful.""  The area was just noticeably swollen and bra caused discomfort upon contact.  It had been present for 1 month and did not go away, so I visited the Doctor.  
No rash, no bumps, just a small amount of tenderness if pressed.

MD thought perhaps muscle strain of pec.  I don't recall any accident, bumping or anything that would cause a strain, but I did shovel plenty of snow in December and maybe that set something off?  I was sick with a virus of some sort for about 2 weeks in December and initially thought that I had a swollen lymph node from that illness.  I recovered from the illness and the swelling/slight discomfort remained.  

Swelling did not go down after resting the area from exercise, utilizing heating pads and taking advil.  

Mid February-still same, re-visit MD.  Breast exam by Doc reveals nothing substantial, but I do have large breasts (38G), which may make it hard to detect any abnormalities.  Doc sent me for mammogram.  

Mammogram of both breasts and then follow up mammogram of breast and area that is swollen did not show anything abnormal.  The ultrasound of the swollen area did show a lymph node that was slightly enlarged and does not have a fatty center (this is what the MD Radiologist said). I don't know what that indicates or could indicate.

I will be visiting a new Primary Care Physician in the next week or two, as we have to change docs.  

My current PCP mentioned seeing a breast specialist, but he doesn't seem concerned.  

I am not trying to make something out of nothing, I just don't feel quite right and these changes have been present now for over 2 months.  

I am a 33yo female with no significant health history.  I have PCOS and had my gall bladder out last year due to gall stones blocking the duct.  That is it.

I will greatly appreciate any advice or suggestions you may have.

Thank you. :)

                Hello, I have begun to notice a few painful lymph nodes, like they are swollen, but they don't feel real big. I noticed this in both armpits and in my groin/upper thigh on my right leg. The pain isn't really bad, but it's noticeable. I worry about diseases like Lymphoma and HIV because I know swollen lymph nodes in multiple areas of the body is an early sign of both of these diseases. I know injury can cause swollen lymph nodes, but I haven't had any real injuries recently except maybe a bruised muscle in my right arm from messing around with a friend a couple days ago, but I don't think this would cause painful lymph nodes in both my arm pits and right groin, but I don't really know. Also just to note I haven't been sick recently except for a little sinus congestion for about 2 days about 2 weeks ago so I don't think the swollen lymph nodes would be from that. I'm basically trying to figure out if all this could be caused by some little injury or if I should worry more about these lymph nodes or what. I would really appreciate whatever help you all could give me, thank you in advance!

PS:  I should mention I do have two children 10 & 2.  But, I never, ever breast feed, nor did my breast enlarge during pregnancy and leak before or after.  Don't know if I even can produce milk.

                Hi there,  I posted this question already but i left out some detail.

about 5-6 months ago i experienced a really soar throat and major pain in my mouth due to an impacted wisdom tooth, I went to the dentist and he told me that i have impacted wisdom teeth and that they will have to be extracted. I didnt have the cash to get them removed because of how bad they are I have to go to an oral surgeon, they said it would cost me 250 dollars a tooth and i need 4 extracted, so the dentist prescribed me antibiotics he said that it will give me some more time. I only took like 2-3 anitibiotic pills and the pain went away. So I stopped taking the antibiotics. 5 months later (recently) i started experiencing headache and some minor jaw pain then i noticed my neck was swollen on the left side (cervical chain) sometimes i feel some pain in my neck also..

My question is, is it likely that the swelling in my neck is being caused by the impacted wisdom teeth? I was supposed to take all the antibiotics the dentist gave me, but i didnt i only took 2-3 of them because the pain went away.  Im not sure because last time my impacted teeth were bothering me i felt pain in my throat and mouth. And now I have no pain in my mouth or throat, just headaches, swollen cervical chain left side, & minor jaw pain . I also remember when my impacted teeth were bothering me it was hurting on the left side the same side i now have a swollen lymph node..

I started taking the antibiotics the dentist gave me a week ago, im on my last day with the antibiotics. Since ive been taking them i havnt noticed any increase of size on my neck.. My neck is only a little imflammed, u dont c any balls on my neck it just looks like my neck sticks out a little more on my left then my right..
I also havent noticed any decrease in size on my neck since ive been taking the antibiotics.

please let me know wat u think

I didnt take the antiobiotics because I had no pain and i didnt set an apointment to remove them because i cannot afford it. Is it possible that my posterior cervicsl chain lymph nodes on the left side are swollen due to an impacted wisdom tooth on the bottom left side? which would explain why I feel some pain in my jaw on the left side.

                Hey, I'm a 14 year old girl, and for the past month and a half, I've been pretty sick, but It's basically off and on. I've lost 12 pounds, had a stuffy nose, stomach aches, changes in bowel habits, constipation a cough, fevers, horrible headaches, joint and back pain, sore throats, tiredness, weakness, loss of appetite, chest pain, you name it, I probablly had it. I had an upper GI test done with the results being only mild reflux, and my blood counts indicated a viral infection (lymphocytes being around 52 and WBC being around in the 4-5 range). My doctor said it should go away in about 3 weeks, and it really hasn't. My worst concern is that the lymph nodes below my jaw are growing slowly, and they are both pretty firm and won't move, at about 1-1.5 inches each. They don't hurt, but my neck does. I'm also scared because today, while lying down, I felt a pretty big, about ping pong ball sized, maybe a little bigger, lump along the front of my waistline on the left side a few cm from my hip bone. It's also hard, and it kind of feels like I have two lumps connected or maybe one that has another part on it. I don't know, but it doesn't really hurt, but the area around it hurts. I don't know what to do, I'm meeting with a gastro specialist, but I don't even think thats the problem.. Help please, I don't know what I should do :(

                I am a 33 year old very fit and active female with two swollen lymph nodes in my right groin.  One is 1 inch long or so and has been for about 6 months.  It seems to be slightly bigger than it was a few months ago but not much.  The ohter is really small and just popped up about 1 month ago.  I saw my doctor (Navy doc) about a month ago and she ordered a CBC and ultrasound.  I follow up with her next week for the ultrasound results.  My blood work came back normal except for low RDW and MPV.  Here are my numbers:  WBC 5.2 (4.5-11.0) RBC CNT 4.47 (3.8-5.1), HGB 14.1 (11.7-15.5), HCT 40.7 (35-45), MCV 90.9 (81-100), MCH 31.5 (27-34), MCHC (34.7 (32-36), RDW 11.7 (12.4-15.3), Platelets 250 (150-450), MPV 6.7 (9.6-12),  Neut# 2.9 (2.3-8.6), Lymph# 1.9 (.9-4.9), Mono# 0.3 (0-1.1), EOS#0.1 (0-.5), Baso# 0.0 (0-,2), TSH SENSITIVE 1.180 (0.465-4.680)
**Up until a week ago, I had little to no pain associated in my pelvic area.  Within the last week, I have at times an intense achey pain that radiates to my low back.  It goes away but is occurring more frequently.  
**I have also been itching my forearms quite a bit in the last 8 weeks but figured it was just the dryness of Winter.  **I'm tired but I have three kiddos under the age of 4.  I've had two c-sections due to breech presentation (3 years ago and 10 months ago).  
**I also have just started in the last 2 1/2 weeks to have slighly blood tinged discharge. Some of it will be brownish blood and some will be red.  

My question is what does an ultrasound find?  What kind of questions should I be asking my PCM next week?  Being it the Navy health care, things sometimes move extremely slow even if time is of the essence.  I have learned through friends that you have to advocate for yourself and push to get the right tests and to see the right docs.  The wait for specialists can be a while even in serious cases unfortunately.  It took from the time I decided to see a doctor about the enlarged lymph node to the time of a followup post ultrasound 9 weeks.  

Things that come to mind are lymphoma and ovarian cysts or some sort of reproductive cancer.  It could be as simple as an infection too.  I just though an infection would have showed up on the CBC.  

Should I have the CBC done again to note any major changes?  Is another scan recommended?  Biopsy of the lymph node?  

Thank you in advance for your advice!  I appreciate your time.

                Hi all:

I would like to know what the significance of a steadily decreasing MPV may indicate.  I have been concerned after reviewing the past 2 years worth of CBCs and have noticed my MPV decreasing from a 7.4 (June 2008) to 7.1 (October 2008) to 7.0 (October 2009).  

This last one was coupled with a low RBC count of 3.75 and a low absolute monocyte count of 159.

I've been experiencing many infections including multiple UTIs, and respiratory infxns (both upper and lower) over the past two years, but have attributed it to the stress of completing nursing school.  I've had depression (again, which I've attributed to school) and the school MDs thought I had generalized anxiety due to the frequency of my: illnesses, and repeated visits to the school health center with generalized symptoms (fatigue, insomnia, muscle aches/pains, depression, etc).

My health hx includes hypothyroidism (which I've had for 3 years now post-RAI treatment for Grave's disease--a form of hyperthyroidism) which is successfully controlled by Synthroid.

I am prone to throat infxns and have noticed that I have pain & tenderness on my neck towards the back of the throat when I press on certain areas (such as my jawline).  It also feels like I have swollen lymph nodes around there sometimes (right under my jawbone), but no MD seems to believe me when I tell them.  

My CBCs have not been compared with the other results (because of the discontinuity of care between my PCP and my school MD), and I am the only one who seems aware of this trend.  Can someone please help and give me some advice on this?  Should I be worried and bring this up to my MD???

Thank you all.

                My 86 year old grandfather has just been diagnosed with lymph cancer.  From my research I can see there are lots of different types and I havent found out which one it is yet, some are slow growing and others are really aggressiv. Apparently he had some lumps under his arm, which had joined into one within 2 weeks, and it is in his chest too.  Does this sound like one of the more agressive types of lymph cancer?  He is undergoing 3 weeks of radiotherapy, and if thats unsuccessful he will have chemo.  
I know its hard to comment with such little information, but I really wish I knew what his prognisis was and whether im worrying about nothing.

                My dad has resigned himself to the hospital 3 times in the past 3 months.  The first time he was in, he was treated for pneumonia, flu/influenza, and ultimately bronchitis for 5 days. All involved massive doses of anti-biotics. 

The second time, he made it inside the ER and was tested for flu again and some blood tests but they released him claiming there was nothing wrong.

The third time, he was there for 3 days, this time they claimed he had pneumonia.  He is a chronic smoker, 2 packs a day, so they blamed it on his smoking. Though the first and second time, his lung scans/test showed his lungs were perfectly healthy.

At some point his doctor said (maybe 1 year ago) he was showing some signs of leukemia but later dismissed this.  I did some research on the symptoms on leukemia and he seems to fit a lot of them: persistent fatigue, weakness, frequent infection (i.e. the flu and bronchitis), loss of appetite or weight, shortness of breath when physically active, bone pain.

So, I would hope that the hospital would check for this but I am not sure, does anyone know if they do?  Feeling bad enough to want to go to the ER 3 times seems a little extreme for him having nothing?

Thanks in advance for any help.

                Hi everyone,

I am hoping someone can help me here.  I did a blood test about 3 months ago as part of my routine checkup, and my WBC came back at 13.1 I believe - everything else was normal.  I did another blood test a few days ago, and my WBC is 12.1, again, all my other stats are within normal range except HDL which was 33, with the minimum being 40.

Anyways, this time we also did a differential on my CBC - all results came back in range except for my ANC - this number came in at 8,480 - the to end of normal range being 7,800 from our lab. 

I feel fine though, no sweats, no appetite loss and I do not have any infections or anything currently (I think at least, no fever, no vomiting), or even back when I did the blood test first time, I felt fine then.

So now I am really scared, and do not know what is causing this high neutrophil count.  I came across CML - and the article mentioned several things:

1) Alot of people do not feel any symptoms at the start
2) They became diagonosed off of a routine blood test

So I am starting to think that this is it.  My doctor is on vacation and will be back next week.  But what do yo guys think?  I can't seem to come up with any opther explanation (except my smoking perhaps).

                My wife was recently diagnosed with acute myelogenous leukemia. Everything I look up has different information. One thing I read said the 5 yr survival rate was only 15% whereas another thing said anywhere from 30-50%. It also said after chemo, remission rate was around 85% but long term prognosis was not good. Her hemotologist won''t give a straight answer (yes we're going to see a different one...myself, an oncologist in our family, and her GP aren't even 100% convinced it is AML at all) I realize there are different forms of AML, and I think it's monocytic, but again, the doctor refuses to talk in ""everyday language"". Does anyone have any solid information on this? I'm going crazy here. She's a white 65y/o with a history of b12 deficiency, one minor stroke, Lyme disease and severe anemia(long time ago). But other than that, no other health issues.

                My friend died today from Acute Leukemia. He was in his early 40's. He had flu symptoms all week and could barely get out of bed. Friday he wasn't feeling to good and complained of Nausea. His Wife went out to get some meds and electrolytes (Gatorade) and we she got back he was found collapsed in the bathroom. It took 30 minutes for Paramedics to arrive and when he got to the hospital he was diagnosed with Acute Leukemia and was in a Coma. The Doctors and Surgeons decided he would make it on the operating table. This morning I received one of the worst calls ever telling me was brain dead. I raced down there and was able to attend his Last Rites Prayer Service- Something I hope not go through anytime soon. It was extremely painful. He was taken off Life Support at 1:15pm. 
My question is what could cause such a Massive brain Hemorrhage in the span of 24 hours? He was also a man who struggled with Alcohol his entire Adult life. He was a major drinker especially when the weekends came. I would like to know if this was a contributing factor and again how can this take a relatively healthy man's life so quickly. I need to better understand how this can happen. This has been a tough day.

                I have several painless lymph nodes on my body. 2 auxillary(both arms), 1 in my groin (hard and fixed), and one on the back of my neck (hard and fixed). None of them are huge..I'd say all less than a nickel in diameter. If a person has a lymphoma does it continue to increase in size or does it spread to multiple areas? They have been present for 6 months or more and have not grown any larger. But they are popping up in other areas: from groin to arm, to left arm, to jaw, to neck, in that order I believe. I feel ok other than less worrisome problems like a fissure and costochondritis. A radiologist consult led to nothing as the first auxillary did not even show up on an ultrasound even though it can be easily felt, thus the forum name. That lymph node in particular is irregularly shaped, does this have any bearing on wheter it is cancer or not? All thoughts are appreciated as this has been bothering me incredibly. PLease forgive the hypochondrial tendancies..and THANKYOU

                I am 25 years old, male..On the night of 11th of January, I got a shivering attack while sleeping..The next day I got up and I had feverish feeling along with fatigue..I started to get fever every now along with shivering attacks and then that reached up to 102..I used to take panadol and it used to decrease and I also used to have sweating once in a while..I didnt feel like eating anything...I was really confused because I didnt know what was going on with me..Next day I went to the doctor and he examined my whole body..He observed a swollen lymph node on the left side of my neck and below my ear and no where else..He also asked me if I have had any weight loss to which I said that I had not as I go to the gym regularly and if I remember the last time I got myself checked was less than 1 month back and it showed 80 Kgs, same as before...He told me to start with antibiotics for a while and told me to get some blood tests done..I got CBC done which showed that the WBC's were 3.93, MCH was 25.4, MCHC was 32, RDW-CV was 14.7 and MONO was 11.2..My RBC was also in normal limits.. I was also got the report for Monospot which was in negative..Morover my CRP was 13 which was more than the normal range that stood at 5..I started with antibiotic once a day and among other tests I got the Widal test and Typhidot test done for Typhoid..The Widal test was positive and so was the Typhidot test. Meanwhile I observed another swollen lymph node below the earlier one..The earlier one used to give a sensation when touched but this second one didn't give any sensation..The earlier one was of around 1 cm and the new one was around 0.8 cm...On 26th January, I got my CBC done again and this time on another scale, the WBC came as 7800 while the normal range was between 4000 to 10000, thus normal. However MCH was still low and MCHC was on lower borderline. The RDW-CV was also in normal limits..However the Neutrophils were very low i.e. 26% while the normal range was between 55 and 70..The Lymphocytes count was quite higher i.e. 64% while the normal range was between 25 and 40...I didnt get CRP done but the ESR was 5 while the normal range is between 0 to 15...By chance I got my weight checked on 30th of Jan and it was coming as 76 kgs which is 4 kgs lower than the last time..I dont know if this was because of the change in weighing machine or maybe because of the gym or infection and I still cant make out..However I am just fine now and have no symptoms that I had earlier but these swollen lymph nodes are causing me anxiety as they haven't regressed..I am worred as I dont know what I should do and whats going on with me...Do u think it can be lymphoma, what was it..Do the symptoms go away after antibiotics in case of Lymphoma, is the ESR raised in Lymphoma..Please tell me as I am confused...Please help..

                I have been having bouts of feeling ill for the last year.  It started 8/06 with night sweats, fatigue that often kept me in bed and made it hard to work, a really low grade fever (highest was 100 degrees, my normal temp is 97.9 I've noticed).  I got concerned because of chest pain but an echo was normal. I have swollen glands (most of which have been there for years) in my neck, armpits and groin.  I initially went to the doctor for a gland that popped up overnight in my groin which I happened to see in the mirror. I still have it a year later and it hasn't gotten any smaller.  I also have a hard lump just above my belly button that comes and goes.  Doctor thinks it's scar tissue.

Was referred to oncologist in February and cat scans from neck to pelvis were normal from what they told me.  They noted ""shotty"" lymph nodes.  Doctor was stumped and told me to wait it out, if more nodes appeared or got larger to come back in.  

Felt great all summer but now for the last month have had night sweats every night, temp goes up to 99, rash on my chest (just scattered red bumps that really itch) which I had the last time I felt bad, ankles itching like crazy off & on which I thought was from walking thru some weeds but I keep getting it.  

I've also had lower back pain that doesn't bother me unless I have to stand for a long time, and the chest pain is back.  I'll often feel my heart sort of pound.  I am pretty skinny even though I eat a lot - I'm 5'8"" and 125 pounds.  In the winter when I felt bad weight went down to 121.  

I know I have a ton of symptoms and I think the doctors think I'm crazy, but it's so frustrating to feel good for awhile and not even think about my health and then to all of a sudden feel so bad that it's hard to do the little things.  I'm 35 and have a very active lifestyle and I'm not depressed.  I just don't know where to go next.  I don't want to wish a disease on myself, but having no answers is hard.  I didn't even know what lymphoma was until recently.  My symptoms seem to me to indicate that's what it could be.  But since all the tests they did in February came back normal does that rule it out completely?

Sorry this is so long.

                Hi I am still in the wait and see phase (you can note my other posts for details. Along with the group of masses under my heart, the node in my upper right lung  lobe with irregular borders, night sweats ect.... I have developed pain under my left clavicle. strange thing is I feel like my bones are bruised (only way to describe it) on the right side with intermitent swelling in my right arm and hand that sometimes also goes into my legs. When I have a bad case of night sweats the swelling will subside (I assume it's just water retention) I have had a rash all over my chest and torso for over a year that is getting worse. Some of the lumps become inflamed and then they seem to turn into what looks and feels like raised moles. And some spots stay white and others look like hyper pigmentation. I did have basel cell skin leasions that I had removed 3 times that was on the surface about the size of a nickle. My doctor is trying a high potent cortisone cream but I don't want to put it all over my entire chest and torso as I know thats not healthy. So I'm picking a spot to see if it helps. She also sugested biopsy of the skin. But what would that be for as skin cancer wouldn't spread to my entire torso. Could this have anything to do with the swollen lymph masses and what is cutaneous lymphoma? This is the first time I've heard of it.  I hate the waiting but then just figure maybe the rash has to do with night sweats and just the body's way of ""detox"" Is it normal to have to wait so long for a diagnosis? I've been feeling just low grade unwell for about 2 years with a few bouts of pnemonia and the H1N1 virus in between. But have now had 3 CT scans sense Sept and next one due in March. Is there a quicker way to the bottom line?  I just as soon rule out the negative and stop haveing unnecesary CT scans for 2 more years. Or if I have something deal with it and move on. Thanks for any comments and advice. I'm at the point of just stopping going to the doctors and just keep on living as best I can except I'm tired of feeling low grade flue all the time and needing to sleep abnormal amounts.

                Hello and thank you for this forum. I had posted earlier on a different forum and then found this one, which seems more fitting.

I saw my fam dr. last Friday for a recheck of my blood pressure, etc...I am female and 57 years old. A couple months ago I noticed a very prominent swelling in mid abdomen. I was not much concerned as it was directly under (behind) an area of incisions where I had surgery back in 2003. I thought it was just some scar tissue building up, although I did wonder why it would take 7 years to do that. This is a quite large lump. A few weeks ago I was having bad headaches that I was able to pinpoint to an area in the lower left area of my head at the very bottom. I felt another pretty big lump in this area. It seems it is right where the head meets the neck on L side. I thought it was probably a swollen knot in muscle and I was having tension headaches.

When I saw my Doc I asked him about the lump on my neck and it felt it for a long time saying it was pretty big and movable then he found another one on my neck, same side not as big. Then he checked my abdomen and confirmed that was also a large lymph node. I felt almost panicked at this point and still feel that way. He ordered a chest x-ray. And, that was all.     I am concerned about him ordering a chest x-ray when none of these lumps are in my chest. What does a chest x-ray have to do with it? I am also concerned that he did not order any tests in the area of where these lumps are. I can only believe there is something I am not getting. The x-ray was only ordered in relation to the lymph nodes as he was not even going to order it until he felt these lumps. 

So, I am depending on someone here to hopefully help me understand the reasoning for this. We were talking while I was there and it did not even strike me as odd until hours after I had left his office.

Any advise or suggestions, or even thoughts about it would be very appreciated.

Thank you!

                Hi....I would appreciate any advice anyone can share.  I worry that my doctor is ignoring my symptoms.  I am a 32 year old AA female, and I don't smoke, drink and I don't have any known health issues. 

9 months ago I noticed a swollen node on my neck.  My doctor watched it for 1 month and then decided to get an ultrasound done which came back ""normal"".  That same month, I developed chest pains - to the left of the sternum and above the breast.  I was diagnosed with chostochondritis.  I was not convinced and had heart workups done (EKG, echo, cholesterol tests, etc) which were all normal.  I also went to the ER and the ER doc said that I do not have chostochondritis because my chest would be tender when pressed. I told my GP that....and she just ignored me and said i have chostochondritis and should get steriod injections (I haven't). 

I still have chest pains...it feels like a 10 lb flat weight is on  my chest and i have a deep dull achy feeling just to the left of the sternum. Nothing relieves it....it is always there.  I have had two chest x-rays (last one was in May 2009) and they were both normal.  All of my bloodwork has been normal.  In October, I had an EGD and my esophogus was normal.  Believe me.....I want everything to be normal....I just want to make sure nothing is being ignored. 

I now have another swollen lymph node on the other side of my neck.  They are both pretty small (less than 1cm) and not painful.  They have not gotten larger.  But i am most concerned because the one on the left has been present for over 9 months....and my chest pains have been present for over 9 months.  I have also had recurrent headaches for 2.5 years with very localized pain (always in the same spot).   

I don't have any other symptoms (no night sweats, fever, fatigue, etc). 

Could this be something more than chostochondritis?  Could there actually be something growing in my chest causing the pain despite the normal x-rays from April and May?  Should i be pushing them to rule out lymphoma? 

Thank you so much for your time!!!

                For around 2 years now, I have been able to feel lymph nodes in my groin and under the right side of my jaw. There is one pea sized node on each side of the groin. There are two under the right side of my jaw, both the size of a bean. None of these are painful. They move around when I press on them. I have no other symptoms. I was told by a nurse that this is normal. I would like a few other opinions.

Thank you

                Hi, I am a 24 year old female.  In October I had a sinus infection and then an ear infection. I had blood work done after having these because I got a stomach flu, had really bad nausea and diarrhea. My white blood count was 18 but has since gone back down. The ER doctor sent me for more tests like an abdominal ultrasound and chest x-ray. The chest x-ray was clear, the ultrasound was good except it showed I had a slightly enlarged spleen that was 14.5 cms. Also during all of this I was diagnosed with Anxiety because I was freaking out and having a racing heart and rushing to the hospital every other day. My doctor prescribed me effexor for the anxiety which I have been taking for a month. All of the blood work I have had done since has been perfect, I have also gone for a pelvic ultrasound too just too get that checked and everything was good.  My doctor sent me back to get an ultrasound to check on my spleen last week and it has gotten bigger, it is now 15.1 cm in size. As you can imagine I was crying and really scared in his office, e is sending me to see a hematologist after the holidays. My question is Do you have any suggestions on what this might be, I am really scared and any help would be greatly appreciated!!

                 Just to give a little back ground on my husband. He has always been extremely healthy, Sept 2008 he became ill, and in Jan 2009 was diagnosed with Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy, was put on a beta blocker and worked like a charm. This Sept 2009 he had a slight cough and went to reg Gen Practice for meds~ he can not just take alot of the over the counter due to blood pressure, gave him anitibiotics and within a week he got the flu ( but before this our cat scratched him on him right side... didnt notice any symptoms .. really didnt think of it any more. as soon as he got what we believe was the flu  fever, chills aches, pains and just plain sick feeling, his lymph node swelled the size of aping pong ball. and over the next couple weeks it would go up and down in size never all the way down, still sniffles a bit.. so I called his Dr. they said to try  some over the counter flu/ cold meds that were ok for BP. we did and now we are over into the end of OCT. the lymph node was extremely sore and painful, fevered and night sweats on occasion. NO WEIGHT LOSS, GREAT APPETITE, so  I contact his Heart Dr. they said to take something ( cant remember) but anyways  it didn't work. so i told him forget it. were going to the Dr. so off we go with this runny nose cough. The Dr. checked him out and said is there anything else besides the runny nose, and he showed her the nodes and she imeddiatly said OMG... we have to get a blood test STAT, XRAYS STAT, and biopsy STAT. and gave him antibiotics , the nodes reduced in size over night and then over the next couple day changed size and shape now elongated, the surgion to do the biopsy could only take us on the 6th , last week. the nodes are swollen and EXTREMELY SORE and fevered. the blood work came back Neg for leukemia, but shwed an infection and  he was slightly anemic which was not out of the ordinary as he had been with the heart issue,
 no other nodes are swollen and still no weight loss , great appetite and feels over all fair. He said the node feels like if he could stick a pin into it it would burst.  I am really scared it is something bad , but he does not feel it is  seriouse... JUST LIKE A MAN~
He thinks it is sothing related to the cat issue/ flu but the Dr said Ohhh it wouldnt be infection for that long... my thoughts are.. if you have an abcess and no treatment  it will not go away just as a abcess tooth doesnt just go away until treated . Help me if you have any input~
 he is set for an extraction biopsy this friday

                Hi, I am a 42 year old female with problems with an eczema rash for about a year and a half.  It was diagnosed as eczema and seems a bit better lately.  One of the areas that I have had the rash is my face and neck and upper chest. 

I have been treating it homeopathically and so the progress is slow.  I noticed something catching on my collarbone the other day when I had my arms raised up.

I felt around and noticed a lump about the size of a small kidney bean.  It is in my left collarbone area.  It must be a lymph node.  There is nothing else around that it could be.   it is soft to the touch and moves around liberally.  I assumed that it was swollen due to the inflammation in my neck but when I looked it up I got really scared.  I do sometimes lately get sweating and the chills and some night sweats (they have diminished at night because I changed my blankets recently).  I assumed that I was in the early stages of perimenopause as I only have one ovary but now I am so worried that I could have lymphoma.

Does it show like this?   I feel healthy, when I sweat I took my temp. and it is normal, I do not have a fever.  I also have bad eczema that can affect your body temperature regulation.  I also do not feel fatigued and everything else seems normal.  I only experience itching as it relates to my eczema and it is not really that bad.

I am also not sure the lymph node is swollen.  It falls into about a 1 cm size but it is the only one that is that size.  It pops out of my clavicle when I raise my arms.  Like I said I am just worried now.  Please let me know if anyone has any thoughts.  I am also a bit of a hypochondriac so some of the sweating could be related to stress.

thanks,

                I am a 19 yr old male in good health (and feels fine) and for the past several weeks, I have had recurrent ""petechiae"" on my feet, ankles, and the lower parts of my shins. I first noticed them as tiny speckles at the base of my toes, but didn't seem them as a concern until they begin to spread. They come and go for the most part, although the ones on my ankles are pretty much always there. They are concerning to me because I recently noticed a very tiny bump in the lower back base of my skull, and also about a month and a half ago I had a supposed ""cyst"" (although my dermatologist wasn't sure-it went away but left a purplish bumpy patch of skin). I also have some sort of rash on my back and I had a sinus infection a week ago that is now gone. I have had two CBC's with differential lately, as well as a wide range of other tests, which were all normal. The petechiae are very subtle in relation to the pictures I have seen online, and cannot be easily seen unless looked at in good light. I am still worried about the possibility of AML (possibly aleukemic leukemia cutis??) but it is possible I have Schamberg's Disease? My mother claims she has had it before. 
Also, my GP didn't think they were petechiae, but when two pediatricians I know seemed certain they were, I went to my old pediatrician who thought thats what they were but wasn't completely convinced. None of the doctors I have seen see any cause for concern, but I'm still worried. They certainly fit the description of them, tiny purplish-red spots that do not blanch. Should I be worried? I appreciate any comments!

Words that are sticking out when I add them up seem a bit more serious then I have taken it. bilateral apical scarring posterior upper chest bilaterally along pleura. once again irregular nodular opacity  of 10x 6 mm(previous one was 7x6 a week before and the previous one to that said 6x8mm) I assume a little differential due to different radiologists reading and first two are w/o dye, last with dye.  other terms, mild coarsening of interstitial lung markings and minimal air space disease remains. Also mild thin walled cylindrical bronchietasis. persistent adenopathy is suggested along the right heart border above diaphragm which is stable at 3.3x2.3 cm. (note only other comparison on that area is from a week previous stating the largest node in that are was 3.2x1.1cm that was w/o dye) with a cluster poster to this which measures 3.3x2.4cm I am completely confused by all this thanks for response

                Well this may take long, but I am very nervous. So please bare with me... Well it all started on November 13, 2009 I noticed I had a sharp pain down by my pelvic area in between my thigh. So I went to check it, and it was a hard knot there the size of an ingrown hair. It wasn't at surface, I could feel it under the skin. So I didn't think anything of it. Until the next day the pain became more intense. so not only did I feel the knot, the whole area on the outside was swollen. Even the left side of my vagina. That freaked me out so I went to urgent care. The doc there said it looked as though it was a hernia. He orderd an ultrasound and put me on light duty from work. That Tuesday came for the ultrasound, and the tech seemed a lil suspiscious. Two days later I get a call from the doc saying I had swollen nodes. He prescribed me ciproflaxcin 500mg. By this time the pain and swelling had went away but the hard knot was still there. I made a appt in the mean time with my primary to follow-up. I went in to see her she checked me, and told me that it could be inflammed nodes or neoplastic etiology. That freaked me out. She referred me to a surgeon but the appt wasn't until Jan 8th. I freaked out even more, but she said that it was ok becuse she really wanted me to see him. So now the next step is a biopsy??? Has anyone had the same problem like me????  Advice please, I am scared. Oh and i got blood work done it came back normal, and an x-ray of my chest came back normal....

                My brother had abdomen discomfort for a few weeks and after a stomach flu failed to ""flush"" what he had assumed has a blockage, he went to the doctor last Friday. After feeling his abdomen, the doctor ordered tests, including a cat scan and when they returned he gave my brother a referral to a Hematologist at a cancer center in our city for the following Wednesday (yesterday). Leukemia was mentioned.

Today, my brother went to the Hematologist and following a blood smear test with results described to me as ""not good"", the doctor ordered a bone marrow biopsy scheduled for tomorrow morning.

I'm *incredibly* scared and worried for my big brother, and the fact that they are getting him a bone marrow test so fast has scared me even more. My understanding is that Doctors prefer to avoid them if possible and while I'm sure that it's necessary I am wondering if it is common for a Hematologist to be able to get a patient in to have this test done so quickly? Does that mean he's in worse shape? I don't want to ask him these questions because he's got enough stress on his plate, but I'm going crazy with worry. If *anyone* can help and just let me know if this is or is not a normal time table from referral to biopsy, I'd appreciate it. Even if it is indicative of him not doing well (well... as well as one can be when diagnosed with Leukemia) it would ease my mind to at least know that.

We gave her Paracetomol and she was okay. Then the fever came back after 21 days. Since then she has been having fever every 15 to 20 days. This has been going on from Dec 2008. She was admitted in the hospital 3 times. After then every time she gets fever we give her Paracetomol(5ml of Crocin 125mg or P250) and the fever goes down after 3 to 4 days. She had fever 15 days ago also. She also complains of abdominal pain around the naval which lasts for half an hour. We did an ultrasound and CT scan of her abdomen and the doctors mentioned that she has multiple mesenteric lymph nodes. The first ultrasound mentioned Parailiac and mesenteric lymphnodes. The second ultrasound mentions that the parailiac nodes are not there and the mesenteric nodes are still present. The CT scan also mentions the same. We just completed the third ultrasound which shows that the lymph nodes are 1.9cm, 1.7cm, 1.5 cm and 1.4 am. 

We did a bone marrow test in March 2009 and it was thankfully negative.

We just did a biopsy in May 2009, and it says""Non-specific hyper placia"". During the laproscopy, they only found nodes 5mm by 5mm and hence did a biopsy on that. They did not see the 1.9cm node. Is that okay 

The LDH level in May 2009 was 649 while the lab range in 460. Also, in the LFT, alkaline phosphatase is 172 while the lab max is 140. 

We did another ultrasound of the abdomen after 3 months in Sept 2009, and the lymph nodes are still the same. The LDH after 3 months is 662.  I'm am struggling for answers. One pediateric infectious disease doctors says it could be periodic fever syndrome. We have been experiencing this for 9 months now as very very concerned. Any help and advice

Patient was diagnosed with AML M2 few weeks back, and has been hospitalized.
Started chemo (7 /3 regiment) and currently not receiving any chemo, as doc is doing blood tests every now then to check for wbc and platelets count.
now, the wbc was 0.2 and then 0.4 till it reached 1.1, and then yesterday started decreasing, now it's 0.7. and so are the platelets.
I need to know if this is an indication of any sort, that maybe the drugs did not work, or that the blasts are returning, thus the low count of white cells, can you please answer urgently?
Also i need to know another thing. The doctor asked for some cytogenetic tests (fish inv 16 and (8:22) ) , and she was negative on both, does this indicate that she is in the infavourable or intermediate prognosis, or has no indication?

I got very scared about having a swollen lymph node and went to my general practitioner last night.  They examined me and felt the area I was referring to. Conclusion was that it was just my neck muscle and a location where my neck muscle might be slightly larger...but as I ran my finger along the area I could tell it was all one long muscle and not a lymph node. 

What I'm wondering is, could I have an inflammed or swollen node UNDER the muscle that is making it seem like I have a swollen node? 

Could this be a posterior cervicle lymph node or anoth node at the base of the neck...

They said I could have an ultrasound...but I said know...now of course I'm thinking about doing it.

                My mother is 76 with terrible spinal stenosis and clogged arteries from her head to her heels.  For several years her hemoglobin had been low - never above a 9.  Mom always insists on treating herself, and took up to 20 advil a day trying to lessen the back pain.

Last February she couldn't walk and was in terrible pain, so it was off to the hospital.  Her worst nightmare.  Hemoglobin was 5.8.  Three units of packed cells lasted only 2 weeks.  It's not cancer, but she's being treated by a wonderful heme/oncologist.

Mom has hundreds of AVMs - arterio venous malformations peppered throughout her stomach and duodenum an deeper into the small bowel.  They constantly blow out and bleed.  The gastro doc has tried cauterizing the wost of them with deep bowel enteroscopy, but it makes no difference.  She needs to be transfused every one to two weeks.  The docs now say there is nothing else they can do to even slow down the bleeding.

Has anyone else ever come across this before?  Her heme doc is checking with docs at MD Anderson here in Houston for experimental ideas, but not holding out much hope.  Thanks for reading.  :-)

One of them is at least twice the size of the other one and they are both inflamed, both types of antibiotics (one stronger then the other) did not work. my test came back negative for mono and strep. The only pain i recieved was at the beginning for 3 days and then the pain went away. But it hurt alot i could not talk or eat and i had huge body aches also. It happened the first night of my menstral cycle that month. I have lost like 5 pounds in about 1 week, i have a swollen lymph node in my neck, i have headaches more periodically, sore neck and back, and easily tired, plus chills all the time. I am 18. but have been smoking for 3 -5years... my jaw has also started hurting the same side as my enlarged tonsil. i had a little hard lump in my armpit before this happened but it went away a couple days before my tonsil became enlarged. my moms side of the family is known to get breast cancer. my immune system is fine and i have never had tonsil problems before. And the last couple days i have begun to notice that my body feels weaker, i am more prone to bruising and scratches. Before i hardly ever got bruises. i am typically a healthy person, slender, and excerise outside mostly everyday. if anyone has ideas of what this might be then please reply.

I've had a very slight fever for about four days but that's normal for this time in my cycle (I've been charting for a long time, as we've been trying to get pregnant). I always go to the worst case scenario so I was looking up the symptoms for cancers: I have experienced ups and downs with my weight for no particular reason for a few years now (I'm a bit underweight & have GERD, which is being treated ok I think). I'm always fatigued, but have attributed that to my job. I'm 30, have a family history with some breast and skin cancers in it. 

Would you be going to the doc right away? Or should I keep an eye on it a while? 
Thanks.

                how did things turn out for you? I had a CT scan done two weeks ago, I felt I had pnemonia so asked them to check for that as I didn't want a false positive, sure enough I did.  But they ended up doing a larger area, found a mass under my heart that was 3.2x 1.3 cm and the original one in lung was 6x7mm irregular borders,  I knew they would find a bunch of scattered nodules in my lungs as I just knew I had pnemonia.  I did they did a follow up a week later with dye contrast.  The doctor said things looked good and do a follow up in 3 months.  Then I read the reports myself, and in one week the lung nodule was 7x10mm and the one at base of my heart was 3.5x 2.3cm that sounds like growth to me and that was after I had done the antibiotics for pnemonia.  I am doing another round of antibiotics. Yet getting pnemonia sypmtoms back.  so I'm confused, it looks like growth on the report but my doctor said it was stable on the unrelated nodes to pnemonia, so now people are telling me to get a second opinion.  I just don't know what to do, I'm tired of going to doctors and tests, yet I don't know if I should just blow this off.

                First post--
I have one swollen lymph node on the side of my neck that has been there for about a year. It is firm, palpable, non tender and fixed. While at the dr. he discovered another one on the same side along my jawline. I had a CT scan without contrast and I am taking the films to the ent next week. I have had no infections/ illnesses for the last year. 

My question is- on  a CT without contrast, what would be a ""normal"" appearance vs. an abnormal appearance. 

Also, why else would nodes swell besides infection- and if I have not had any infections, what could the cause of the swelling be (side from cancer)?

I am a mother of two little ones and am in nursing school- I am worried and I could use a little advice- can anyone help??
Thanks!

                Last week I went to the ER with severe scrotal pain, abdominal pain and flank pain. The diagnosis was a kidney stone since they found a tiny one in my right kidney. The next day I went back to the ER with the same symptoms and pain in my left groin which turned out to be my lymph node. They did a Cat Scan, Ultrasound of my abdomen and testicles and blood work. Now they came back with the diagnosis that my lymph node is enlarged and I have a small varicocele that should not be causing any symptoms. Its a week later and the pain remains but my main worry is I lost 20 pounds in 2 months. I lost 4 pounds since Tuesday (its Saturday). My mom who was an RN suggested I go to my Dr and ask for a biopsy of the lymph node since cancer does run in my family. I have also noticed rashes in my arm pits, and I have been lethargic over the past month or so. Wouldn't the Cat Scan, Ultrasound and blood work show something? I have been trying to lose weight and eat better but its just a weird coincidence that the weight is just falling off.

Thanks

                I have all of the symptoms of either leukemia or lymphoma (labs and physical symptoms) and three doctors concur and have referred me to a hematologist/oncologist for further testing/diagnosis/treatment.  All of the doctors (Internist, Allergist, and Rheumatologist) are leaning towards lymphoma but cannot rule out leukemia.  Anyway, my appointment with the oncologist is Jan 8th.

Here is my question.  Because of the severe bone/muscle/abdominal pain and all of the stress my fiance bought me a 90-minute massage.  The massage therapist was talking to me before the massage and when I told her I was going to be evaluated for lymphoma/leukemia she told me she cannot massage a patient with those cancers because of the impact on the lymphatic system and the chance of metastases.  After I thanked her I went into the steam room and bawled for 10 minutes before I thought ""well, is a steam room or hot shower/bath also bad?"".   

All of my doctors are pretty much out of town until January so, here is it:  What are the things you are NOT supposed to do with lymphoma or leukemia?  I can't find a reference anywhere.

Thanks!

                Hello everyone.  First post...

I was recently diagnosed with Non-Hodgkins Lymphoma (NHL).  I start a series of 8 weekly Rituxan treatments tomorrow.  So fare I have only told my wife and my boss but have not told any of my friends or most importantly my son.  He's 20, in college, and I really just didn't want him to worry but more to focus on his own life and continuing to excel at school.  

In reading about Rituxan I noted that in some cases patients have a reaction and can die, usually from the intial treatment.  Now I'm questioning whether I should tell my son just in case the worst happens.  

Any thoughts?

I can't see much benefit to making him worry.

                I have had swollen lymph nodes for three years on my neck. Some appear and then disappear. There is one on my neck that is rather large and never goes away. I have about five right now all around my neck. I have to get  a blood test and a CT scan tomorrow. I have some symptoms of lymphoma: coughing and shortness of breath, fatigue, itching, and night sweats. Could I have cancer?

                Okay I know this sounds crazy but I'd thought I'd come on here and ask my questions. 

So my son is 4months old and is a very happy baby. He was born at 33 weeks of gestation but came home a week later. Since he's been born he's been hospitalized a few times for dehydration, pneuonmia, etc. He recently had  a brain injury and had a surbacrhnoid hemmorage. I wont get into that right now but I have another concern. 

When they did his MRI of his head for his bleed...the report came back that Jack had midly prominent lymph noes especially in the anterior cervical chains included on the exam. The largest of these nodes is 1.4 cm's in short axis on the right. it says there were quite a few of them. 

I took him to the doctor and he had no sign of infection so there was no reason for the lymph nodes to be swollen. 

Also every lab I go back and read...it's been abnormal. He's never had a normal CBC. I will post a few results of what they looked like. I was just wonderin if I should be looking more into any of this. I dont like seeing abnormal cbc's and then the MRI on lymph nodes coming up. Any advice would be great. Heres his labs. 

Btw the doctor didnt metion following the swollen lymph nodes and she hasnt repeated a CBC since the last one.

I am a 29 year old female, mother of one (three year old) I don't smoke, don't drink, don't do drugs.  Overall I am fairly healthy.  But I feel unhealthy all the time, please help. 

Here's the facts: 
Positive Tilt Table Test 
Potassium = low 3.3 - doc. recommended suppliments 
SGPT (ALT) = low 8 
Esinophil% = high 3 
hematocrit = 36 
MCHC = low 33.8 
Vitamin D = low - levels not, but enough that my doc recommended suppliments 
Everything else appears normal, I even had: thyroid tests - TSH, T4, T3; ANA Titer; Cortisol (AM); ESR (Sed rate); B-12 level check; Protien; Albumin; A/G Ratio; Globulin; and CBC work-up 

Here's the symptoms: 
fatugue 
numbness hands and feet (possible carpal tunnel) 
restless leg syndrome 
shortness of breath with little physical assertion 
weak hand grip 
cognitive fog 
memory loss (short and long term) 
weakness 
hoarseness (voice changes, hard to explain) 
slightly enlarged tongue 
thinning hair 
skin changes (no wrinkles but I am aging very quickly) 
Skin tags 
loss of elasticity in skin 
headaches 
mood swings 
climbing steps or sitting for a period of time can bring symptoms about 
joint pain (knees, elbows, hands - i have even had fluid removed from my knee that appeared ""clean"") 
occasional chest and rib pain 
pale 
dark circles under eyes 
Non-restorative sleep 

What could be wrong with me? I have found a few possibilities but I don't know what tests I need, or if I'm even on the right track.   
Possibilities:  Amyloidosis 
                    Leukemia 
                    Renal Insufficiensy 
                    Parathyroid disease 
                    Villous Aedenoma 
                    Renal Tubular Acidosis 
                    Fanconi Syndrome

                    Hashimoto's Disease (and other thyroid disorders) 
                    Aldosteronism 
                    Cushing's Syndrome 
                    Adrenal Tumors 
                    Hepatic Dysfunction 

My doc. just wants to treat my lab work with suppliments, rather than finding a cause for these abnormalities, what should I do?  I feel like I am being robbed of my life, my quality of life *****, I can't do anyhting I am always sick.  Where do I turn? 

Any help would be greatly appreciated - PS last year an MRI of my brain revealed chiari malformation with syrinx - however, 2 specialists and a neurologist deemed it asymptomatic. - no other signs of brain disorders (MS, etc.)

I just want to know what is wrong with me because i have no symptoms of any infection or sickness, just swollen lymph nodes.

Thank you very much.

                I went for my follow up CT scan for a small node on my lung.  I haven't felt well for a few years nothing major just bone aches chronic cough night sweats,  ect. Anyway I ask the technician if it'll tell if I have pneumonia as I've been sicker then normal for a month. So I get home there's a message my doctor wants to see me that day.  I call back and tell them I can't as I didn't have transportation, so just have her call me the secretary says well you have pneumonia, I said well good that's better then the spot growing so call me in some antibiotics and I'll get them picked up when I can. She said well the doctor still wants to go over your report.  I said well have her call me.  Secretary calls back and said the doctor finds it important enough to see you today she is coming to your house for a housecall.  I thought how bazaar I never hear of doctors making house calls.  She comes and goes over the report.  Says I have several nodules in my lower lung, I said well that would be in response to the pneumonia wouldn't it? she says yes but I also have several at the base of my heart some are 3.2x1.4 cm and then I have a larger cluster of enlarged nodes in the space between my heart in lungs in the chest cavity and several on the outside plane of my right lung. Also a calcified spot on the tip of my Kidney. She and the radiologist did the report together over the phone and said I need to have a complete scan all the way down through my pelvis with dye contrast to find out if there are more masses or nodules.  For some reason this is not sinking in that this could be serious, I'm still thinking it's my lymph system fighting because I haven't felt up to par for so long. The report says due to size and location of all the nodes and masses he doesn't feel the nodes are a reaction to the pnemonia. Should I take this serious, I'm just relieved I just have pneumonia that can be fixed and the nodule they were looking at for followup hadn't grown. My doctor says it can be lymphoma. How long does it take to diagnose that. she is having me go in this friday for blood test which I'm not sure what they are for and the scan on Monday. Couldn't that give me a false positive since I will only have just finished my antibiotics and my lymph nodes could still be swollen from the pneumonia?

                Married 23y.o. white male here, athletic, in good general health. 6'3 250lbs

At the beginning of August, about 4 1/2 months ago i had a pain in my left neck shoulder area i noticed when i would raise my arm. After feeling around I felt what turned out to be an enlarged lymph node in my left lower neck. Everything on line of course pointed me to cancer for that specific node. However, I did have a bad head cold a few days after I noticed it with bad pflem and stuff. 

After getting back from vacation, 2 weeks later it was still there so went to the doctor. They said it felt normal, but did a chest xray, and this came back normal. They then prescribed me antibiotics for 2 weeks and came back and node was still there. So the doctor went ahead and scheduled an appointment for me to see an internal medicine specialist. 

At this point a month and a half had gone by, Still felt the same, but had noticed another node directly below the one on my lower left neck, and another swollen node in the same general place as these two on the right side. At the specialist, she did a ultrasound/sonagram? on the nodes and measured them at a little less than a cm and told me that i should take another 2 months before coming back and they look benign.

2 months went by, I have noticed that there are small pea sized nodes swollen on each side below my ears are a little tender. But i dont know if these have just gotten larger or are the same size.

I do have anxiety which makes me nervous and a grandfather that passed away from Non Hodgkins Lymphoma a few years ago. 

Last, I went back into the doctor when it would have been over 2 months. I didnt know if i should go back to the specialist, so i went to my general practicioner at school health center. She felt my nodes, and said they all still felt no bigger than 1 cm on my neck and the ones by my ears are just very small pea sized.

I have had no other ""main"" symptoms: no night sweats, no weight loss, no bad fatigue

I guess my question is, thoughts? Should I still be worried? Should I go to another doctor? 

Any advice or comments would be helpful

                Over the past year or so my tonsils have become extremely large; they were not always like this. This occurred painlessly and I did not even notice it for a while. The lymph nodes in my neck are also swollen, but they were not painful and I did not really notice them either. About four months ago I awoke to a numb tingling sensation in my left shin. This tingling and numbness occurred for roughly two months straight, and now it comes and goes. I have been feeling extremely fatigued and tired and a little out of it. This is very frustrating since I have a two jobs and college to deal with. It is literally disrupting my life. I have also been having a lot of headaches, which I normally do not have. For a year or so I have also been getting sores and cuts in my nose that come and go, although recently I have had them about four or five months. I also have been having fevers of 99.2-100, which is high for me since my temperature usually runs in the 96-97 range. I have gone to the Neurologist because they thought I had Multiple Sclerosis, but he looked at my MRI, said I was fine, and did not do anymore tests. Although I am not sure what he expected to find since I am only 18. I also saw a Rheumatologist and she check me for Lupus and all of the tests came back negative. There are several abnormalities on my blood test which included
CA-High 10.3
HCO3-High 30
TIBILI-Low <.1
Anion Gap-Low 6 (has been consistently low for four months)
Ferritin- 11
I just want somebody to be able to put this all together for me.
On a side note I am not sure if this has anything to do with this other stuff, could be totally unrelated, but I have also had bronchitis 3 times in the past year.

To give you a little bit of medical history... I have had skin issues where I have itched all over.  Tiny bumbs, weeps, and last year I had enlarge scaps form on my elbow and one on a buttox.  There was a watery substance underneath.  The itching has occured twice in my life and both times where when I was around VERY hard water.  When I started lotioning more and moved to where the water was softer the problem seemed to fade away.  There has been another instance where I had strange hard, peeling skin around my penis and the side the shaft was swollen.  I went to the doctor and he said I had a fungus .  He gave me some medicated cream and it went away.  I also had bumps in a pubic hair and he said there was no sign on herpes.  But what I am worried about the most now is the swollen lymph nodes in my groin.  What could that mean?

If it isn't definitive why put him through chemo, when we still don't know what the nodules are.   Meanwhile, he has no symptoms.  He does not have a cough.  He is not short of breath.  He exercises and walks every day with no problem.  If it wasn't for the lump that he had in his leg, (which was removed) we would not know any of this.  My question to anyone that can help is:  Has anyone heard of this with lymphoma?  Could the nodules be just scar tissue from  previous pneumonias he has has over the years?  Do we wait and see if the nodules are less in numbers in three months?  I'm at a loss.  If anyone can give me some advice I would appreciate it.

                Hi, i went to the hospital about a few days ago for nausea, vomiting, and extreme pain in the left side of my back where my kidneys are at. The hospital was horrible, i had to visit two times in one day and they never gave me a diagnosis. The second trip they actually ran blood test but when the doctor saw me he never told me anything about my blood labs and sent me home with pain meds. These are my Blood lab results.

Im not sure why the doctor didn't say anything about any of this if there are a lot of highs and lows...my belief is he wanted me out of the hospital and didn't want to waste his time looking at my labs..i had to ask a nurse to find my lab results for me. I have been experiencing fatigue, soreness, swollen lymph nodes, and a swollen stomach. They did a CT scan without contrast and everything looked normal.

                Hello all

I have posted in several other sections as I have been taking test and it seems they have led me here. 

Quick background, 2 lesions were found on my brain MRI after complaints of severe persitent headaches (5-8 daily).  Had several types of EEG, Full body catscan, a lymph node biobsy (was found to be enlarged in the scan) and a lumpar puncture.  My doctors have essentially ruled out MS.   

The biopsy showed an abundant number of lymphocytes and scattered histiocytes.  The LP cytology report also indicated the presence of small lymphocytes.

Can lymphoma cause brain lesions?  how can they test for lymphoma?  any response is greatly appreciated.

                I've been feeling really crummy recently. My neck, shoulder, and arm have been bothering me badly on the left side. Of course, being someone who overreacts, I immediately thought it was my heart, even though I'm 26 and generally healthy except for hypothyroidism and other minor things. I don't have health insurance until January 1st, and I attempted to make an appointment with my doctor today but she refused to see me. When I saw her back in August, I expressed an issue I'd been having with my neck being stiff, which bothered my shoulder, and subsequently my arm. She did nothing but say, ""Go to a neurologist."" I hadn't been able to go to a neuro and the pain continued to increase. In mid-Oct. I ended up in the ER having a panic attack (my PCP simply gave me the names of psychiatrists rather than see me in office and make sure it wasn't a more serious condition...I won't be going back to this Dr) and again expressed my concern for this pain. The ER Dr said he was most confident in it being a pinched nerve, but without xrays he couldn't diagnose it. 

Now, over a month later I'm still having increasing pain. The newest development, though, is that I've got a weird achy feeling in my chest above my breast and below my collarbone. It goes over to my armpit, and then down my side. I've still got the pinched nerve symptoms too, they are quite severe right now. As this odd feeling crept into my chest, I began to worry it could be something with my heart. It's been about a week now, and nothing heart-related has happened. I've watched my heart rate and it's steady at 68-76bpm whenever I check it (several times a day) and about 104 when exerting myself. But the achy pain in my upper left chest is turning to a sort of weird burning feeling. I felt around, and located several small lumps that are quite painful. There is also pain in my left breast where it attaches to my chest by my sternum. Again, there are small lumps. There are matching lumps in my armpit and on my side next to my chest. The lumps are small, pea sized and hard. 

I've had an ache in my collarbone also, and located on the left side only, a squishy quarter sized just below the bone. I've found a matching squishy sac on my shoulder, the one that is very painful. The other worrisome thing, is that I've had an achy pain below my left breast, where I'm assuming my spleen is. 

I don't know what to do at this point. I'm very freaked out, but I don't have insurance, and with my doctor refusing to see me, I'm left with the only option of going to the ER. I'm trying to avoid racking up more bills that I'm not financially able to pay at this point, but if it's something serious I want to get it checked out.

Does this seem like something concerning to the point of going to the ER? Any advice would be amazingly helpful! 

Thank you in advance :o)

                For the past 5 months, my lymph glands have been swollen. Primarily on the left side of my neck, directly beside my pulse. I have had a series of blood tests over the course of this year checking liver, gallbladder, kidneys and a complete blood count. All test results are immaculate. Of course aside from my B12 deficiency, which seems to be at bay now. But it's like I went from being the healthiest person alive to being extremely unhealthy in 0.5 seconds. My doctor is hesitant to biopsy because of my near-perfect test results.

Symptoms include: Persistent red throat (no pain when swallowing), frequent colds, intermittent feeling of water in left ear, left tooth pain, left arm weakness when left tooth pain occurs, frequent bouts of nausea (no vomiting because I loathe vomiting and will do anything to prevent said occurrence), hormonal imbalances, frequent itching + hives, dry skin, and nasal irritation.

Most recently I've been suffering from a horrible flu-like virus that has rendered me nearly useless for 2 weeks. I'm on week 3 and still coughing up a weird taste in my mouth, though my cough is mostly dry. I can't liken it to anything metallic or any other substance that it could closely resemble. It tastes like... infection, maybe? But where is it coming from? 

The lymph gland I'm focusing on here is not tender to the touch. It never has been, even when I am sick with a cold. Ok, maybe it hurts A BIT when I push hard enough on it. But no strep throat or any other infection has been identified. In fact, I've never suffered from a strep or tonsil infection in my life.

Perhaps I'm in the wrong forum here; and if I am, would someone please guide me in the right direction?

Thank you in advance for any help that can be sent my way.

I do notice if I get a sinus infection,for instance, it makes the swelling worse but over time or after medication they do tend to get better. Also, since April of this year, I have had an extremely stiff neck. It feels stiff/tight 80% of the time. I take advil and have my husband massage my neck often. Its hard for him to massage alot of the time because it does cause pain. Could the stiffness in my neck be from lymph nodes on the back of my neck?

                Hello everyone i posted in the cancer section however this seems more specific. To start off, i'm 17, male, in good physical condition with no history of serious illness or such. I've had post nasal drip for about 3 months which is clearing up with allegra. i've had swollen hard lymph nodes on in my right groin for a month now, however i also had a large cut and scratch there, and i heard it was normal for them to be swollen. The nodes in my groin are also sometimes painful and can ache. However recently, and more worrying is my neck. It has felt a little swollen and sore and i think my lymph nodes both under the my jaw on the right side, and on the side of my neck are both enlarged and sore. Im not sure if the lymph nodes themselves are sore but my neck certainly is. However i also have one enlarged node on the lower part of my neck where the superclavicular lymph nodes appear to be. Its not painful (the node itself) and appears to be quite mobile and rubbery'ish. I am very worried because i read online statistics that say whenever the right superclavicular node is enlarged, there is anywhere from a 50-90% chance that its cancerous, most sites say 80-90%. I was just wondering if these statistics are for when ONLY the superclavicular node is enlarged while the surrounding areas remain unaffected, or is it just super clavicular swelling in general is usually a sign of cancer. All of my afflictions are on my right side only, swollen nodes in groin, under jaw, side of neck, and possibly superclavicular. 

If this is bad news, how long do I have before it starts spreading? I know there are different kinds with different rates of infection, but assuming i have the most aggresive cancer possible, how long would i have before it worsens? The reason i ask is because i may not get the chance to go to the doctor for another 2 to 3 months. Please help, i am very worried.

                Hi everyone!  I found an enlarged lymph node when I was in college two years ago.  I got it checked out immediately but the doctor told me it was most likely normal so he gave me some antibiotics to help.  It never went down.  My doc told me it was probably a lymph node that will never go down.  So I accepted that even though that sounded where.  Well, fast forward two years... I now have discovered a few more enlarged lymph nodes.  (The original one is still present.)   I have a hard time telling how big it is but I would guess 1.5 cm.  They are very hard and do not move.  I have not had any recent illnesses so I don't think it is related to that.  My only weird symptom is that I am exhausted 99% of the time and have no idea why, I get plenty of sleep.

I would LOVE any advice.  I plan on seeing an ENT next week because I just feel really weird about this.  Thank in advance for any comments or suggestions!

                Hey guys, I've been a browser of this forum for a while and thought I'd finally post a question of my own. I'm not going to lie, I'm a bit worried about my lymph nodes and the possibility of lymphoma.
Little background info:
I started feeling enlarged lymph nodes at the end of June this year. A few weeks after, I had a case of a Staph infection and was put on sulfameth for a week, it cleared up fine. Unfortunately my lymph nodes didn't go down after the infection. I went into the doctors a few times to try and find some answers, and in late July was diagnosed with Mono (which was a relief). The initial monospot test came out negative, but the EBV titers were positive for Mono. For the period of time I didn't know I had Mono (I thought I was just very tired from school and adjusting back home) I drank a few times and smoked a few days a week. When I found out I had it, I stopped for about a month, got tested for Mono again before returning to school in September, and Mono was cleared from my system. Since then I've gotten a cold and bronchitis, and am still dry coughing occasionally.

The reason for my worry is because of my symptoms, which are the following:

generalized lymphadenopathy, after probing over summer I found clusters of them in my groin area, found at least 3 on each sides of the neck and one on both sides of my supraclavical region (above collarbone) - the last of which is my main concern as I've read the inflammation of collarbone lymph nodes is reason to go get checked out (which I did, my doctor didn't seem concerned at the time). In the groin area, there's one on each side that seem fixed and hard, I don't know if that's just it's structure if that's a reason to worry about malignancy.

pressure in chest, sometimes on right and sometimes on left side - a dull ache that I imagine is coming from right below my rib cage area. Initially thought this was caused from anxiety however it is almost daily so I don't know if that's the case.

elevated heart rate, I feel as though my heart is beating out of my chest at times. I can feel my pulse in all of my lymph areas etc. and though often times when I test myself I have a 'normal' heart rate, sometimes my resting rate is slightly over 100 bpm.

soreness and hardness in testicles, not sure if it's related. I had a testicular ultrasound when I was feeling the soreness the most and everything came back fine.

muscle spasms - sometimes they are close to or feel as though it's the lymph nodes. happens for like ten seconds then goes away, but happens often.

the lymphadenopathy I have a question about. I'm a skinny guy, is it truly cause for concern if I can feel my collarbone lymph nodes? None of the lymph nodes I explained are visibly inflamed, just can be felt under the skin if I'm looking for them.

also, I've heard that lymph nodes take a while to de-swell - I can't seem to find if this is normal for me, to have fairly inflammed lymph nodes for about five months straight due to the staph, mono, cold and bronchitis my body has been through. Some of them seem larger than they were initially, however they're not ""growing"" as far as I know, if that makes sense. Like, certain ones seem larger day-to-day then will go back down to normal.

I've had a CBC twice (2 month interval) with completely normal results (other than the EBV titers changing) and the doctor said my WBC was directly in the normal range. I never felt thoroughly checked by my doctor though, he'd quickly feel my lymph nodes and tell me they're not big enough to have any suspicion to biopsy.

I'll be getting a chest x-ray soon for peace of mind, but should I truly listen to everyone telling me not to worry? From what I've heard, without a biopsy it's hard to tell, so how is my doctor, a family-friend nurse, college medical center doctor, and friends and family so sure that I'm worrying too much about all of this? I'm just trying to figure out what's wrong here and can't seem to find an answer.

If you have similar symptoms or did have them and was diagnosed, please let me know! Or anyone wanting to shed light here, I'm all ears. I do admit that I can get a bit anxious and that doesn't help in this situation.
Thanks for reading.

They didn't tell me anything about my wbc but gave me a printout of the test. It shows that my wbc is 11.6. It says the reference range is 4.8 - 10.8. Is this too high where it can be lukemia? I am now worried seing that. Also it says my lymph Rel RESP is L 23.4. 

If any has any knowlage of this it would help for some info

                Hi, i have been getting a petechiae rash appear on my forearm for about 2 months now. I get about 10 dots appear close together and then disapear within an hour. They will then re-appear on other parts of my forearm about a week later, again for only about an hour duration.

Is this anything for me to be concerned about? I have been reading up and many people say if it dissapears within a day its normally nothing seriuos.....any truth in that?

                Hi all,

I woke up last night and realised my underarm was really sore, I thought my bra was pushing on it so I thought nothing of it- when i got up this morning and felt under my arm there is a lump :-( It has suddenly come i think. When i looked in the mirror i saw the underarm skin on both sides looks particularly..'scaley?' would be the only word i can think of. I'm just a bit scared! I am in the middle of endocrinology referrals to get my underactive thyroid treated. When I got the blood tests, my lymphocyte cell count was fractionally high but they told me it wasnt to worry about as it wasn't high enough to indicate anything bad, it was literally .2 over the threshold. Only other thing is that i am on citalopram for anxiety.

Can someone advise whether this sounds like a serious lump?

Thanks,

Clare :)

                Hi, 

About a week ago, I noticed an oblong shaped, painful lump basically on the line where my thigh meets my pelvis. Anyways, at first, I attributed it to a pulled groin or just doing something weird but it hasn't gone down at all and the other side doesn't have it. I started doing some online research and just got nervous with some things I found, as I have had other medical issues recently (abominal pain, unexplained anemia and unexplained weight loss). Let me tell you more about this lump though. It is hard, not moveable, about an inch and a half long, centimeter wide, very painful when pushed, and when my legs are down, you can tell it's there (not visually, but if you run a finger over it). I'm nervous because I have lymphoma in my family and am worried somethings gone wrong. I also have a fibroadenoma in my breast. I'm at school and don't really know where to go, and don't want to go to student health, but also don't want to rush to a doctor if it's nothing to worry about. Let me know what you think. 

Thank you, 
Tevon

                Is it too soon for doctor to confirm as lymphoma
by DSPoole, Oct 17, 2009 05:47AM
Back in July I noticed a small lump on the left side of my neckjust below the jaw and ear. It is painless and quite hard and seems fixed. I went in to see my family doctor, he did not seem overly concerned and sent me for blood tests. About a week later I had not heard anything so I called to find out the results. His office informed me that the blood work had come back fine and that they would send me for an ultrasound. After wainting approx 3 months I had an ultrasound done. It was recommended that I have a CT scan done to have a better idea of the complexity of what was going on. A week later (Oct 15) I went for a CT scan. Yesterday my doctor called to say he would like me to come in to discuss the findings of CT scan. He informed me that he is almost certain that the mass on the side of my neck is a lymphoma and that the Ct Scan shows something about 2cm at the back of my tongue. He has now sending me to an ENT doctor on Monday. Is it too soon to be panicking without yet having had biopsy and if it is what doctor fears what is the prognosis.   Thanks Doug

                My 3 year old son has always had larger then normal tonsils. He has been seen by doctors who have shown little or no concern about the enlarged tonsils. I took him to his paedritician 2 days ago and she took a look at his tonsils and showed concern at their size. He is not sick, has not had any antibiotics for the last 8 months, is eating fine and his weight seems to be steadily increasing. She said that there may be 0.5% - 1% chance of lymphoma. He suffers from allergies and I just try to keep his nose clean so that the allergens don't fester there and cause infection in his nasal passages. He is to see a ENT in two days to assess the situation. I am beside myself and I don't know what to do or how to deal with the scary prospect. please advise.

                Please bare with me, I have somewhat of a long story, and am anxious for some sort of an answer, as the doctors have not been able to come up with a diagosis.

4-6 weeks ago I had a sudden onset of constipation, abdominal cramping, inability to pass gas or stool. Severe bloating and abdominal pain came from this episode. After two days of pain and discomfort, I attended the ER for some answers. They believed my symptoms suggested constipation or some sort of bowel obstruction. I was given a fleet enema, and CitraMag to flush out my system. This made me feel better for about 8 hours. After which i was in pain again and feeling bloated. To cut to the chase, I attended many doctors appointments, and ER visits to get to the point I am at now. My last ER visit showed a rise in my WBC. Ultrasound showed borderline enlarged spleen and liver. As well as some mild bowel wall thickening. I was prescribed cipro and flagyl for one week. 
My symptoms seemed to get better at the end of the round of antibiotics. However within a few days I was feeling abdominal pain again, and feeling very fatigue, on and off headaches and warm flushes in my face. By this time I had been referred to a GI specialist. He had me in for a CT Scan. The results for that are listed below:

FINDINGS:

There is mild wall thickening and haustral thickening of the distal descending colon extending towards the sigmoid. There may be diverticula in this region. There is no evidence of other abnormality in the area however at the present time. There is no pericolonic stranding. There is no abscess. There is no free fluid in the abdomen or pelvis. There is no bowel obstruction. 
The intra-abdominal organs are all normal.

There are a few small lymphnodes in the root of the mesentery extending towards the right lower quadrant. The largest of these is evident in the midline and measures 12.7 x 8.8 mm.

IMPRESSION:

Mild wall thickening in the left colon as described. Etiology of this is not determined. This may reflect diverticular disease or even focal inflammatory change. There is no evidence of acute diverticulitis. 
Colonoscopy can be considered.
Very mild mesenteric lymphadenophy. This is non-specific. It may be reactive. Etiology is not determined. 

Following these results, the GI Specialist prescribed me cipro and flagyl again, this time for two weeks, and increased the daily dose of the flagyl from twice daily to three times daily.

During the course of this antibiotic trial I had lots of symptoms.
-Bowel movements were loose, contained mucus, and sometimes little black specks, almost like coffee grounds. Never saw any blood.
-Muscle cramps and severe muscle pains in arms. Would go away by the next day usually.
-Numbness in wrists, hands (pinky finger side only)
-Head aches
-Very tired / fatigue
-Loss of appetite for a couple days, really run down
-Back and chest pain
-Burning sensation in stomach
-Neck and shoulder pain
I am sure there are others that I cant remember at this time.

Near the end of this antibiotic period, I had a colonoscopy done. This showed some small diverticula. I was told otherwise my colon was healthy. 

After finishing the medication last week (Wednesday October, 21st 2009) some symptoms have subsided, however some new ones have arised. 

-Still feeling fatigue during the day, trouble sleeping (waking up with weird dreams during the night, usually around 4am)
-I noticed a lymph node in the left side of my neck, towards the back that seems to be a little larger that 1.0cm by 1.5cm. It seems like it is smaller in the morning, or after a warm shower, and later in the day or evening it seems to get larger. I also have noticed another lymph node on the right side of my neck, which is in the middle of the side of my neck ,just above the collar bone. I have some pain in the left side of my neck, not directly where the swollen lymph node is, or mass? not too sure.
-Over the past 4-6 weeks I have lost aprox. 20lbs.
-Some mild pain in lower left and right abdomen that comes and goes. Might notice it 5-8 times throughout the day. 
-Bowel movements seem to be a little better.
-Head aches that come and go, not severe enough to knock me out. 
-Some times will feel like a pin ***** pain on my leg or my arm. 

If anyone could please shed some light on this , that would be greatly appreciated.

                Here's a quick question. Is it safe to get Botox (for Migraines, not cosmetic) with Thrombocytopenia, it's quite mild, about 115k?
I'm subjected to Gov't run health care (not that I'm complaining tooooo much, at least I have care) and 99% of the time one Dr. has no idea what the other is doing.... I'm certain that the Neuro Doc has no clue I'm cytopenic, nor even knows that I'm involved with Hem/Onc as it's two seperate cities (same system though)... but, I'm really wanting the Botox for migraine relief.... well??? What say YOU????? (Okay, for all the tree lickers, yes, I now it's a toxin and where it comes from but, .... for goodness sakes!!!!! I've been on CHEMO & Radiation !!!!!!! so, no comments!!)......

                Started having swollen lymph nodes in Sept. of 2009, currently the main symptom seems to be loss of weight in my extremities.  Mainly my legs and they are achy and muscles and buttocks feel like they are burning sometimes when I sit down or lay down.  I don't notice this as much when walking around.   Had CBC tests and kidney and liver enzymes, and HIV as well.  Ultrasound of lymph nodes in neck as well as Xrays.   I am not tired really, and the main problem is just my legs.   Sometimes I feel like I'm running a low fever, but when I check it I'm not.

Just had a CBC a few days ago and this was actually while I was on Clindamycin for a mouth infection I had on the roof of my mouth after a dentist removed something lodged in my gums.   The CBC was within normal limits except Neutrophils were high and Lymphocytes were low.

I guess I'm worried about possible Leukemia or Hodgkins or Lupus.  

Here is the full CBC:

October 15th 2009 CBC

WBC 8.3
RBC 4.95
HGB 14.4
HCT 42.3
MCV 85.5
MCH 29.1
MCHC 34.0
RDW 12.5

MPV 8.8

Abs. Lymphocytes1.6
Abs. Monocytes 0.54
Abs. Eosinophils 0.08
Abs. Basophils 0.02
Neutrophils 73.0 which was high, up from 48 on Sept 13th 2009
Lymphocytes 19.3 which was low, down from 38.8 on Sept. 13 2009
Monocytes 6.5
Eosinophils 1.0
Basophils 0.2

ImmunoGlobulin

IgG 1193.0
IgM 190.0
IgA 301.0

Seeing an Endocrinologist this Wednesday just to see what they might think.  Considering having a lymph node biopsy and maybe aspiration done.

I had similar symptoms back in August of 2003 and in 7 months time I had 8 negative HIV tests, negative diabetes, negative ANA, negative Lyme...  this just seems like it's something that reoccured which bothers me... 

Any suggestions would be appreciated.

Thanks,

                My husband was diagnosed with Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia back in 2005(right before our wedding). Up until today, we were in the ""watch-and-wait"" mode, going to the oncologist every 3 months for blood work and every 6 months for CT scans. He also had a bone marrow biopsy & aspiration done once, about a year ago. 

Well, today's visit was anything but ""normal"". For starters, my husband's WBC count dropped, from 54000 all the way to 37000. I realize these jumps & dives are typical for CLL, but his count has never gone down more than 2000-3000 at a time. On the contrary, it has jumped 18000 in a 3-month timeframe, and I think it was noted at his last visit in October. Second, while listening to my husband's heart, the doctor seemed to take extra, extra, extra, extra, extra looooonnnnnngggggggg. When he finally stopped, he made some brief comment about detecting an irregular heartbeat, but then moved on as if nothing was wrong. My husband has never had any cardio issues before and this comment about irregular heartbeats set off bells in both our heads. 

But here's the most concerning part of the visit, and my true reason for posting: While checking my husband's lymph nodes and spleen today, the doctor became very concerned & alarmed when palpating the spleen, stating ""it's very, abnormally enlarged"". According to the latest CT scan on file, which was done about 6 months ago, my husband's spleen was enlarged at that time, too. But the doctor wasn't able to palpate it on physical exam back then. So now he ordered for my husband to have CT & PET scans done this week. He also mentioned that my husband may have to start chemo(w/Fludorabine) ASAP, getting it every day for one week/month, as well as blood draws every day while on chemo. 

Has the leukemia reached a ""point-of-no-return""? How much time does my husband have? How serious is the splenomegaly? Will it get better? Worse? What stage does this put my husband in? Will he need chemo for the rest of his life, once it's started? Will he have to be hospitalized every month while he's getting the chemo? Will he have to get a VAD, like a Med-port, PICC, or Hickman? 

Thanks, ahead of time, to anyone who replies. I'm just a very scared wife right now........

                On Sep 13, I received a Flu Shot from a local drugstore.  A couple of days later my left axillary Lymph Nodes began to swell.  After about a week, the swelling was down somewhat.  I visited my health care provider who told me it was not systemic, and not to worry, that was on Sep 21.

On Oct 2, the swollen lymph nodes had spread to adjacent nodes in my left armpit.  Originally it was 2 or 3 nodes in the center of my armpit.  This time, it's about 4 to 5 nodes, out side the original swollen nodes.  One of them, in the front of my left armpit is very large.  I revisited my HCP and was again told not to worry, sometimes it can take a month or more for the swelling to go down.  

Today, on Oct 9, I was checking the node out and when I pressed on it, some bloody pus was discharged.  Further pressing resulted in some more discharge.

Since my HCP has todl me not to worry twice now, should I go back, wait and see, or seek emergent care elsewhere?

Thanks

                Thank you for your help in advance, I am 48 years old and I have 8 children, 6 girls and 2 boys all are grown and have moved on with their lives. I put 'other' in the topic line because I'm not sure what I have and I'm being totally honest with you, I just don't know and my oncolgist doesn't seem to know eaither. I was hoping maybe you could help us figure it out. 
It all started in April of this year. I went to the E.R. with sever chest pains and I was having trouble breathing, I thought I was having a heart attack. They ran an EKG and drew blood work right away. The E.R. Dr. said that my heart looked fine on the machine but as a percausion he wanted to do a CT scan to rule out everything else, I agreed and off I went. I came back from the CT and I had another Dr. come visit me, a Lung Dr. he said that I had some weesing in my chest and he wanted to know if I had asthma, I said no, I have what my GP called chronic Bronc. especally during the winter months. (Mind you it's spring in April here in CT) Anyways he said that he would like me to come to his office and have a full work up done on my lungs when I get out of the Hosp. I told him that I would. Then the Heart Dr, came in and wanted me to stay in the Hosp. over night so that they could monitor my heart over night and do a stress test in the A.M. I agreeded to that too. And yet here comes yet another Dr., this one made my heart sink when she told me what kind of a doctor she was, she was an Oncologist. She began by telling me that they had found 5 enlarged Lymph Nodes near my heart on my CT Scan. Then she said that my Lymphocyte count was 76, which didn't mean anything to me at that time nor does it now. She then dropped a bomb and said that she thinks that I might have Hod. Lymphoma. I said, ""wow you can tell all of that from a CT and some bloodwork"". Then I began to cry, I said to myself they have to be wrong I can't have cancer I have 8 kids that need me. I went for the stress test the next day, that was bad enough to give anyone a really bad heart attack, they said that my heart looked fine and sent me home. My oncologist called me the next day and said that she wanted me to go see a Cardio Ther. Surgon with in the next week. I went to the Surgon and he looked at the CT Scan and at the Lymphnodes and said that he would try his best to take them all out, as one was really close to my heart he was worried that it would cause me to have a heart attack. He was able to remove them all but I had to wait 10 days for the results to see if they were cancerous or not. He told me that he had sent them to 2 different labs to make 100% sure. The first set of tests came back that the Lymph Nodes were susposably Non cancerous, but I still haven't any idea what the second set of tests showed as he never called me or my oncologist to let us know. For the past six month my Oncologist has had me do lots and lots of bloodwork to rule out different decesies, even Aids, and has had my liver, my painceres, my spleen, my gallbladder and my breasts checked and she has also done a bone marrow bi-optsy looking for anything that may be causing my lymphocytes to be as high as they are and they keep creeping up month after month. She wanted to do a PET scan in April but my Ins. Co. won't pay for it, so I'm gonna go for another CT scan in begining of Dec. My Lympocyte Numbers started in April at 76 , May they were 54, June 57, July 56, Aug. 58, Sept 59, Oct 69, I just don't understand what would cause them to go up as they are so doing? What do the numbers mean, does it mean that I have a lymphoma cancer somewhere hiding in my body as my Oncolgist thinks? And is there something I can do to lower them or make them go back to normal again? I'm just not sure what to think anymore. Thanks for listening to me babble on!!!

In the body of the report it was stated:
""Heterogeneous marrow signal is seen, which is probably due to patient's body habitus""
Some of my research is alarming me.  The MD did not seem to be concerned.
What does this statement mean and should I be alamred?

                Around March I noticed that there was a big bump at the base of my skull. Soon after I found one next to my left ear, and on my neck below that ear (slightly below my jaw). Theres also a rather large one on my wrist but I'm not really concerned about that one.

I went to my school nurse when I noticed it. She told me to wait 2 months before seeing a doctor. I did, and when it was still there I went to see one. He told me that they should go away soon. Its four months later and they are the same size as they were then.

I have not had any infections or cold/flu like illnesses. 

However I am noticing that I am light headed, having shortness of breath and difficulty breathing, tiredness, lack of energy, headaches, and increased pressure in my skull.

I'd like to know if I should see a doctor again and ask for a biopsy to be done. So far no doctor I've been to or asked has expressed the need to do so, but I havent talked to a doctor about it since I began feeling the increased pressure in my skull.

I'm aware it could be a list of other things like anemia, allergies, stress, perhaps all three... but despite that is this something to be worried about?

She is 59 years old and has Rheumatoid Arthritis since 1996.
After experiencing weight loss/ sweating for about 6 months, she was checked by hematologists. Biopsy was taken 3 months ago from bone marrow, and the Lab anatomist conclusion was that she has hyperplasic bone marrow. Many other body tests were done however hematologists did not identify of what is exactly her medical problem.

                6 weeks ago I had a cough and chills. I checked my temperature and it was 101. I stayed off from work that day and could barely move. I had plenty of liquids. The next day my temp was 99 and I went back to work. I had some chest cold symptoms. The following Monday (about 3 days later) I woke up with a productive cough. On that Tuesday, I went to the doctor and was diagnosed with Bronchitis and a sinus infection. WBC was 15000. I received a Rocephin and Decadron injection and was placed on Biaxin for 10days. I still have a low grade temp (not less than 99.4) and also have joint pain and night sweats. I went to my gynecologist for my yearly checkup and told him all this and he drew another CBC. He mentioned a systemic infection as well as possible lymphoma or leukemia. About 2 months ago, I came to the ER with abdominal pain and fullness, nausea and vomiting. On my CT scan it mentioned some enlarged lymph nodes in the abdominal cavity. Could this be something to worry about? Why would my temperature still be elevated for so long after antibiotic treatment?

About 10 days ago, i had a cold and i got a random nosebleed, 5 days after that i was blowing my nose into a Kleenex and i noticed my nose was bleeding again, those 2 time were the first nosebleeds in my life without being hit in the nose. I also have been feeling dizzy  and lightheaded, almost like it is hard for me to focus my eyes, and just today i am starting to feel pain in my right knee when i put pressure on it,i don't know if this is from playing soccer or from leukemia. I have read that leukemia has the same symptoms as the ones i am having, like joint pain, dizziness lightheadedness( lack of blood in the brain), nosebleeds. I am extremely stressed and worried, this may be a cause for some of my symptoms but i am not sure. Could you please give me some feedback or similar experiences you have faced. God bless!!

                Ok, first thing's first. I'm admittedly a hypochondriac.
I went to the doctors today after experiencing the following symptoms: Swollen Legs, Bleeding Gums with a bad taste in mouth and Sweaty Hands & Feet.
I've been taking Minoxidil for my hair(to excess admittedly, twice the recommended dose :S). I amen't noticing any abnormal bruising as I've always been one to bruise quite easily. Although a couple of months ago I hurt my foot and it swelled up and was bruised(doctor said it was just a combination of different injuries causing it to swell).

Anyway, the doctor tested my blood pressure and asked me a couple of questions. She said that she thought the swollen legs were due to the minoxidil(I've only stopped taking it in the last week) and that after looking she didn't think my gums were anything serious to worry about and I should book an appointment with the dentist. She told me to come back in 2-3 weeks if I felt I was getting worse.

Anyway, I've come home and I'm sitting in my room. I can't help but panic as my hands and feet are both sweaty and any small ache or pain i feel i attribute to a serious disease.

Am I being over anxious?

                Hello everyone. I am looking for some advice. I have had swollen glands under my arms, around my groin and my neck and under my chin for some time. They are fairly hard and rigid. They are up and down. I have pain in my back along my spine. I have drenching night sweats and keep having chills and fevers. I have seen an ENT who has done a FNA of a gland in my neck which was inconclusive. I have had every blood test under the sun - all have come back ok. I have had an ultasound around my neck, unfortunately when my glands had subsided a bit. I have recently had a CT scan with contrast. I have yet to get the result of this but as it was a month or so again and i have not heard anything, that must be ok also. My glands were not initially painful but they are now. I have had antibiotics with no effect. I had glandular fever 10 years ago and CMV 5 years ago. Could this be lymphoma?

                I've noticed a hard, painless lump on the back of my neck for more than 2 years now. It is located on the right side of my back neck along the hairline, and about an inch and half from my right ear, and it is in an imperfect round shape and measured roughly about half inch in diameter. When I first found out about this lump, I figured it could be a pimple and would disappear eventually because I’m always a healthy girl, and because it’s painless, I disregarded this lump ever since. However, about three weeks ago, the lump seemed swollen, and I felt a little pain when touching it or turning my head sometimes. I finally decided to go to my doctor, and he told me that it’s nothing to worry about, these are probably just some fat cell tumors that are generally harmless, some people might have it for decades without causing any problems, and it will be possible if I still have it after forty or fifty years if not removed. And I could undergo a small operation to remove it anytime if I choose to do so. I felt certain degree of relief after my doctor’s diagnostics. About one week after my first doctor’s visit, the pain still persisted, the hard lump seemed getting bigger. I went back to my doctor. This time, he told me the pain was due to the inflammation caused by infection. He prescribed Cephalexin 500mg for me, saying that it could reduce the inflammation. Now, with only one capsule left in my prescription, this lump on the back of my neck still causes the same scale of pain. If the swollen and pain are indeed caused by infection, how come the medication that treats infections is not working?

It’s starting to scare the hell out of me, after reading all the relating posts online, I become even more worried, is it possible that I have Lymphoma??!! Please help…. FYI, I don’t have any other symptoms besides a little stiffness on the back of neck, and pain when generally touching the lump or turning my head sometimes.

                I currently have an enlarged lymph node on the left side of my neck.  It is around 1.8cm and I have had it for 10 months now.  I have been to see an ENT aout it who arranged for an ultrasound scan and fine needle aspiration.  The fna came back clear and the ultrasound scan showed it hadn't grown over the last 6 months.  When I first noticed the enlarged lymph node, I had just fought off acute bronchitis which also left me with a wheeze (which I still have now), could the 2 be connected?  I had a chest x ray that was clear.  This year, I have managed to catch every bug around and have found it very difficult to fight anything off (I've had 4 courses of antibiotics in the last year, the last time I had them before that was 25 years ago).  My main concern is obviously lymphoma. However, would I have any other symptoms after 10 months?  Any advice would be much appreciated.  Thanks in advance.

But now 9 months later i still have that same swollen lymph node, which is about 1 cm in diameter, its hard, painless, and fixed in one spot. When i first got this swollen lymph node i was alway squeezing it pressing it and i don't if that is the cause for it being the way it is now. The same thing happened again on a different area except it feels like two swollen lymph are stuck together. I also get swollen lymph nodes on my armpits,which are always tender, warm and hurt to touch, but go away fully after 1 week. I am really worried that i have cancer.

                Hi there,
I'm a 24 year old female who's new to this whole community and joined just now because of these weird symptoms I'm having that I can't seem to explain. I'm not sure if this is the best area to post this, so I hope a mod will move it if it's not. I don't know much about lymphoma but it seems like these symptoms could possibly be related.

Last night over the course of about 15 minutes the lymph nodes in my neck went from nothing to just under the size of golf balls and visibly protruding from my neck. None of my other glands enlarged and I've not been sick or had any other symptoms that would tell me, ""it's an infection"". No fever, no cold, no ear infection, no sore throat, nothing else outwardly wrong with me. The glands weren't fixed, they hurt and were squishy...so it's probably not a tumor. What's weird is that this is the second time this has happened in about a week - same story before, random and no other symptoms. I've never had mono and have never actually had my glands swell to the point of being visible before. The first time it took about a day or two for the swelling to go away entirely, and has yet to disappear today.

I do have autoimmune hepatitis - which has caused hepatosplenomegaly (my liver is enlarged because of the disease, and my spleen is enlarged because it's taken over some of the work of my poorly functioning liver) and stage 4 cirrhosis. I also have always had a tendency to get nosebleeds since I was a kid and because I work as a fencing coach, I always have bruises. I guess I'm just really stumped on this one, any insight would be much appreciated.

                My 17th months old son has several large lymph nodes in the neck area only. At 3 months he only had one large one on the left side of his neck,I took him to a pediatrician and he said all was fine. At one he developed more in the neck area and another Dr suggested a ultra sound and a blood test for virus's. The ultra sound results came back with that he had several large nodes in his neck the largest was 1 cm by 1cm and that he did not have glandular fever. The dr sent me off saying the lumps indicate he has a good immune system and its normal for kids to have this! 

I felt I needed a second opinion and took him to another Dr and said the only way they could tell if it was lymphoma was vai a biopsy? I have decided now that I will take him back to the pediatrion  but there will be a wait to get in and see him, so I hope someone can help me?

He has night sweats and sweats around the neck and head.
he has over 7 large lymph nodes around the sides of his neck.
The glands under his arms and groin are not swollen
The glands have never gone down
he has had small amounts of blood coming out of his nose

My story is a long one, but I am going to try to keep it short. Basically, about a year and a half ago I noticed a lump on the left side of my neck. At the time I had had a case of some pretty nasty sinus/allergy episodes so I didn't think anything of it. What I did notice though is that even after I was over the sinus problems and stuff, the node stayed enlarged. Now it has been over a year since having sinus problems and it still has not shrunk down. The node is painless, but it causes me some discomfort. I've never actually measured it, but if I had to guess I'd say it's about the size of the tip of my index finger. I have had doctors look at it and they usually tell me it's not big enough to cause any real concern and that if it grows bigger to come back. Blood tests have all come back normal and I've had countless ones. As far as my overall health goes, I feel fine. I run 5 miles at least 4 times a week, I lift weights, I'm active, and I have a pretty normal appetite. I sleep through the night without any night sweats or things of that nature. I do still have post nasal drip almost constantly because of allergies and I have acid reflux. Other than that, you could say I'm a pretty healthy person. I guess my question is with a lymph node like this being present for over a year with no real enlarging that I can tell and if it is getting bigger, I can barely notice it, what could it be? I spoke to a guy who had lymphoma and he said he had a lump show up and then about 4 months later he was sick as a dog and that just hasn't been the case for me at all. Any feedback is appreciated. This week I am planning on going to see a family friend who is a doctor for a physical exam of it so I can get a professional opinion, but until then this problem still bothers me on a daily basis and I just want some peace of mind. Thanks!

                Hi. I am 16. Last year when I was in my spanish 3 class at school, I leaned my head over and fela huge swollen gland. It was so large I fel embarassed and kept it covered. I went to the doctor and he said it was a lymph node and it was probably from an infection. Took antibiotics and the swelling went down but I can still fell and see the lymph node. A few weeks later I then discovered another lump on the other side of my neck below my jaw. It felt the same as the other one and we went to see the doctor. He gave me more antibiotics but this one never shrunk. I was referred to a otorhinolaryngologists (ORL). He was puzzled and had a sonogram of my neck done. Indeed I had slightly swollen lymph nodes. He decided that it was possibly an infection. Put me on a Azythromicin (Z-pack) and the swelling never went down. He then scheduled a biopsy of the left side, the original lymph node. I got to the surgical center and was put on the IV and was being prepared. He came in for a last check and said he thought it might be best to watch and see because the lymph node was on my jaw line and he did not want to risk cutting my facial nerve. It has been a year and a half and no exact answers yes.

I now have a lump on my left flank (side) and my right flank. I also have swollen lymph nodes in my groin area. I notice the in class I will sweat in my armpits and it makes me cringe. I wear anti-persperant deoderant. I have also noticed that I have gotten extremely irritable. I am also tired alot of the time. I will find myself waking up and not knowing when I fell asleep. I might have been online chatting to a friend and then waking up laying on my keyboard and not remembering falling asleep. I also have noticed a stiff back and neck especially when taking a shower and standing.

I saw a dermatologist for my acne and she felt my lymph node and told me to go see an ORL again but they again just said your lymph nodes are reactive and that there is nothing to worry about. I also have times where I feel like my whole body is on fire, and I tingle and can't end up shaking. I also get extremely cold and shake.

Blood tests have all come back normal except for a slightly high red-count which the doctor's said can be because my parents smoke.

I have a family history of lymphoma, hodgkins and non-hodgkins in an early age. One uncle had Hodgkins and was in his twenties. The other had Non-Hodgkins and was in his early twenties as well.

Not sure what to do next...I don't want to end up having cancer and being diagnosed late.

                I'm not sure if this is the right place to post this.  Please tell me if it's not.  I have a small lump on my head behind my ear.  It has been causing a lot of pain and disscomfort, especially when I try to sleep.  Before I noticed this lump I had pain and stiffness in the back of my neck the day before(I know this could be unrelated).  I went to see my doctor about it and she said it is either a cyst or a benign lymphoma.  I didn't think to ask what would have caused either one.  I told her that I am also having head aches and neck pain.  She said those things are probably unrelated except for problems in the back of my head and neck because the ""thing"" might be putting pressure on a nerve or something, but that the headaches towards the front of my head are not connected.  It's odd to me that they are not related when often I will feel pain going from the bump to the front of my head.  But she is the doctor.  Does anyone have or know what I'm talking about?  I haven't been able to sleep very well the last few nights and have been getting head aches.  It's almost a burning pain some times too.  She gave me muscle relaxers and told me to wait and see if it improved on it's own.  Meanwhile I am so tired.  Any pressure on it is painful.  Well I'm rambling now because I'm half asleep.  Any advice or insight is appreciated.

Thanks!

                Good evening,

I found several enlarged lymph nodes on the left side of my neck...the most concerning of which is right behind my left collarbone.  

I'm curious what constitutes an enlarged lymph node.  None of the nodes are greater than .5 cm.  The one by my collarbone seems longer than it is tall, but is right around .5 cm.

I've read that any node that can be felt by the collarbone is suspicious, but I've also read that nodes under the .5 cm mark are rarely an issue.

So what is an enlarged node that you need to worry about?  Greater than .5 cm, 1 cm, 1/2 inch?

Thanks for any clarification.

                Hi all,

I recently had an MRI that revealed lesions in the brain.  I have had just about every test you can think of since then.  One of which was a lymph node biopsy.  ( catscan revealed they were slightly enlarged) My ENT keeps saying things like, I dont think this anything to worry about...but.  He put me on antibiotics for a week to see if the swwelling would subside, it didnt.  So we did the biopsy.  First he said benign, then in the same breathe said he could not rule out lymphoma because they found lymphocyte's and histiocytic traces in the lymph node.  If its benign why can't they rule out cancer?  So now I am waiting to go back in two weeks to see about removing them.

Im confused, has anyone had anything like this?  What does it mean that they found those traces in the lymph node?

Any thoughts are appreciated.

                I apologize in advance if my question/post does not belong here.


I developed one swollen lymph node in my right groin (femoral) early August.  I have no recollection having caused local injury to that general area (e.g., scratch/cut, stubbed toe, etc.).  To date, the node still feels swollen, hard and fixed.  It is also quite painful- a dull ache throughout my pelvis (which sometimes refers down through my leg) as well as an itching sensation.

Mid-August, because my PCP had no appointments available, she referred me to the local ER.  ER ran CBC and there was no indication my body was fighting off some form of bacterial or viral infection.  Urinalysis confirmed negative for chlamydia and gonorrhea.  I was then discharged and told to ""Keep an eye on it"".

Last week, I was able to get an appointment with my PCP.  Upon examination, she noted that the node was ""very swollen"" and ""very hard"".  She also noted that I had a swollen node in my armpit as well (right side- which has also been painful).  Due to the pain associated, she wrote it off as something bacterial and prescribed me an antibiotic (Doxy).

I have been on Doxy for a week or-so now, and the pain has subsided some.  However, while showering this morning, I noticed not just the one but a second, swollen hard and fixed node in the inguinal region.

Questions:

• If it is in fact a bacterial infection of sorts, why might a second node pop-up out of no-where?  Could it be cause of the Doxy filtering through my system/fighting infection?

• As far as ""local injury"" is concerned- last night I did engage in PROTECTED sex.  Obviously, won't go into detail, but have noticed in the past after having sex, my pelvis is usually ALWAYS sore next day.  If I had stretched/pulled a muscle in that area, would that cause lymph nodes to swell?

• I have heard - lymph nodes that 'hurt' are not associated with cancer or a viral infection.  Is there any truth behind this?


Many thanks!  Response and insight most appreciated.

                My daughter had blood taken today for a CBC, something about platelets, Uric acid, Peripheral blood smear, LDH, Von Willebrand and some other things that I am not to sure of.  I only saw the sheet for a few minutes.  So when I got home I looked up some of this things and I believe that the Dr's are looking for Leukemia although this wasn't mentioned to me, just that they were looking for blood disorders.

The symptoms that my daughter has been having are,  frequent nose bleeds, usually spontaneous, about 4-5 times a day and sometimes in her sleep, or while riding in the car, or watching tv.  This hasn't happen for about 3 weeks now but did happen for about 2 weeks every day.  she complains of headaches off and on.  Sometimes see say I feel really bad or I feel really sick and goes to bed, she bleeds easily and excessive.  Last week she came home from school and her sock above her shoe was soak with blood, she had a mosquito bite that she had scratch, she said that she fell and hit it and it started to bleed.  Then later that evening on two separated times it started bleeding and quite a bit for a small scratch.   She is also bruising easily and excessively.  She now has an extremely large bruise on the side of her leg going around towards the front and a bit to the back.  It starts just about thigh high and goes down to her knees.  She said that she was going to climb up the latter to the boat and she hit her leg on the side of the ladder. Also she is tired a lot.

So, sorry this is so long just for this question Does anyone know how long it takes for these tests to come back.  I will go crazy waiting as I am already doing.  I plan on calling the lab and ask them but can't do that until tomorrow, so if anyone could give me a hint.

second 114 (quite sick with 104-105 fevers for many, many days) 
was hospitalized C-reactive in hospital was >100
third sed rate in hospital was 83
Discharged- no answers- lupus, arthritis, TB, blood cultures, etc. everything negative.  

two weeks later sed rate is 34 (no fever at time of blood draw)

Could cancer be lurking? I'm thinking unlikey but am worried b/c a CT scan of the abdomen was ordered to r/o Lymphoma and see if there are any kidney abnormalities.

I am not sure if this is in the right place but I hope you can help me. 

I am 16 and for the past month or so I have been experiencing discomfort around a 'slightly' swollen lymph node that is just on front of my left ear. I say only slightly because it used to be quite prominent for about a fortnight a month ago but bow it has gone down so that it is not too noticeable when feeling for it (unless I move my jaw to the right, it becomes prominent to the touch)

for the past month or so (since the swelling has eased) I have been experiencing discomfort around the lymph node in the form of dull aching, throbbing and sometimes even tingling sensations. 

I visited my doctor today but he says that everything seems fine and that I don't have an ear infection etc. But I'm worried, what could the problem be and what can I do to adress it? The pain usually comes as the day goes on. Especially on an evening and is most noticable when trying to sleep. I also only have problems with this single lymph node. 

I hope you can offer some insight. Thank you.

                Before I start, PLEASE respond as I am very nervous about what could be going on behind my symptoms. Thank you in advance, even if you're not sure please just add your thoughts!

I'm a 24 y/o, healthy (as far as I know) male. In mid march of 09 I came down with a respiratory illness. I noticed my lymph node on the left side of my upper neck was enlarged. The lymph node is close to the carotid artery if that makes more sense. One of my friends came down with lymphoma recently, so I started freaking out about this lymph node and kept feeling it several times a day, every day for a week. The node was painful and fairly large. 

To this day, the lymph node is still not down to normal size. It has definitely shrunk, but it seems to have days where it gets bigger and then shrinks. When I swallow, I can feel it, but it's not as bad as it used to be. What really scares me though, is that now the left side of my neck is sore. I also found a small, but palpable lymph node (occipital) on the back of my head on the left side.

Back in March when I came down with that cold I also developed a slight twitch in my fingers when grasping objects. Since then this issue has gotten much better and is barely detectable. Could that have been related to the lymph node as well? I'm confused and scared, PLEASE RESPOND. Thanks so much.

I had lunch with a friend today, one who seems to know a fair bit in the past on health.

But to cut a long story short she told me those who have broken a bone have a higher incidence of getting leukemia.
She said people get leukemia from a broken bone, and that her friends brother got it 6 weeks after he broke his arm.

Is this true????????
My 8 year old daughter broke her bone in 3 places in her elbow last year, and as silly as it seems,  now I'm worried.

                I had sex with someone but it was completely protected.
after 3 weeks of that sex I got lymph nodes in my left grion area. I got white spots on my penis which are very tiny.
I got 2-3 nodes but one is about 1cm and others are small. It starts paining in groin area in today's morning and I felt very soft skin area in my grion.
I got lymph nodes on my all body since 10 years. I got HIV test at that moment but it was negative.
I am wondering that if my body system allows to have nodes but why it is happening with paining in grion area.
I want to know are there any more reasons for pain in grion area.
I don't have any symptoms of flu, headache, nmeumonia, fatigue, fever, nausia, diaherrea, cold and weight loss.
Today I felt loss of apetite when it was paining in morning but nw i m hungry and starting to eat.
someone is telling me it might be hernia.
Can someone suggest me what's happening?

I have a toddler son, who has terrible eczema skin.  He has enlarged lymph nodes EVERYWHERE.  Inguinal, scalp, axillary....

They have done 3 different CBCs on him and both have been normal.  Over a 6 month time period.  

Since he can't really talk or tell me what is going on, I pray that he only has eczema.  But since his main symptom is chronic itching, could this itching be from lymphoma/leukemia, as I have read those are symptoms???

Maybe he was wrongly diagnosed w/ eczema and may have something else?

I guess I was just getting worried & wanted to know if any of you knew of someone who was diagnosed with lymphoma/leukemia with a normal CBC?

                Hi. I am 20 years old. I spent the last 1 1/2 years battling hodgkins and I am now 100% in remission as of March 18th 09. My last chemo treatment was in December 08 and last radiation was Jan 09. The cancer was in the left side of my chest and that was the only area that was radiated.
Since about Febuary/March I have been having this right side chest pain. Under my armpit and a little to the left around my breast area. It started as just a pain upon inhalation. It has started radiating to my back/shoulder and neck. If I hunch forward it gets really bad. When I take a deep breath it feels like I am being stabbed and then randomly it will throb around my shoulder/back and neck. I have been tested for pleurisy, costochondritus, pleural peal and gallbladder disease. I have been on a slew of anti-inflamatories, steroids, pain killers, muscle relaxants etc etc and nothing helps. I have been seeing a chiropractor for alignment and physical therapy for two months now and nothing is helping. It's just getting worst and worst. 
Does anyone have this same problem? All of my doctors are blowing me off thinking I'm just overexagerating or something. I have no idea what to do or who to go to. 
Please, if you even have the slightest idea of what this might be, I would appreciate you thoughts.

I've become slightly concerned with a few of my symptoms.  I have developed over the past two weeks, a tingly face - above the eyes, forehead, and sometimes top of the head and neck. If I leave my face still it can become very tingly but when I move around tends to be OK. I haven't had any blurred vision/headaches, but have recently started working in an office, looking at a computer most of the day (though with regular breaks). I maybe thought it may be a sign of developing poor eyesight? Also I have been experiences a little shortness of breath... I have no idea what this may be... but am worried it may be something relatively serious?

It hasnt gotten worse and if you just look at my feet, you can not really see anything, only when u look close up and when I look in natural sun light, they appear more brown than anything.  They are super tiny, like the size of a dot a very sharply sharpened pen would make.  Thanks for your help!""

                Hi, I am 37 years old and was diangosed with CML in Nov of 2007. I also had lymphoma 8 years ago. I was wondering if anyone might be facing the same decision I am. I take Tasigna and have had a laundry list of problems. I have also been on Gleevac and Sprycel (for a short time).  In the 6 months that I have been on Tasigna I have been diagnosed with carpel tunel syndrome, had my thyroid begin to fail, had really bad menstrual pain this is worse with each cycle and rarely have a good day anymore. You name it and it has happened. It all started with blurry vision in my right eye..like water trapped in a pair of goggles. I usually have chest pain, and am Short of breath going up a flight of stairs. The worst thing is I have no energy most days. My liver function test are always elevated these days.  I have dry eyes that hurt. My hair is thining. My muscles hurt some days. I have nausea frequently and bad heartburn. I had numbness and tingling really bad in my feet for a long while but that is temporarily gone. I have problems with my memory. I had a 6 month period of constant headaches and was told they were migrains.  There is more but suffice to say I am not a happy camper. I had NONE of these problems before I started on these meds. 

Recently I had surgery. I stopped taking the Tasigna in preparation so it wouldn't interact with the aneasthesia. I was off of it for 5 days. By the fourth day (post op day) I felt like a human being and had the most energy I've had in 2 years despite having just had surgery. 

I am strongly considering having a bone marrow transplant as I cannot possibly see my way through 30 years of this. I am told I would otherwise be on Tasigna for life. One doc agreed with me. I went to UCLA and they have suggested I get a work up for several different things which I am in the process of doing. They also conveyed that this is all a weird coincidince but said I could try a 2 week vacation from Tasigna if my next blood test (PCR) is still declining. I know the Gleevac was no longer effective  and I was devp some resistance but I still managed to get a clean bone marrow biopsy and my PCR is on it's way down.

Anyone who has input I would value it, especially if you have CML or a family member. OH< the good news is that I have a related matched donor...my sister.

                Hi,
I am 15, and during the shower I felt two small lymph nodes in the groin area, it was about one month ago.
since then, everyday I kept on touching them to see if they have grown larger, and I think that their size stayed pretty much the same. They are not that soft to touch though.
Also, a few days ago, I felt some pain in my armpit area, so I felt it, and found a really small enlarged lymph node, its not big, and it took me a really long time to feel it. 
now, these days, I keep on getting a stingy kind of pain in the area where my lymph nodes are, but these pain just goes away on it on after a few seconds, and when i touch the nodes or the area, it doesnt hurt at all.
I am really scared since I have been really paranoid and read all the articles about them.
so I am wondering if I need to get them checked out.
and one more thing, how big does a lymph node have to be if it is "" bad""?
and if the lymph nodes don't increase in size, it means that there is no need to worry right?
please help me! I'm really scared ):

Thanks for your time.  I had asked this symptom of my doctor, but he didn't know an answer, So i thought i would throw it out there to see if anyone can assist.

I have a strange sensation along my jaw it is like a strong pulse and dull pain. It moves around, along the top of the jaw, underneath the jaw.  Comes and goes.

I had this about 6 years ago it lasted for a few weeks, then it went away, it came back about a month ago, once again lasted a week then left.

Both these times I was under stress/anxiety and I put it down to that.

This time, it has come back again, but I am not stressed or worried, So I have no idea what it is.

It seems to be in the locations of my lymph nodes, but I dont think/know if it is them.  My partner is a nurse, and she checked my glands and they are NOT swollen, and I have NO fever and i am NOT sick.

Once the pain starts, I start to worry and worrying definately makes the pulsing feel more prominent.

Can anyone assist?

Thanks

He also asked me if I had fatigue, runny nose, sore throat etc. I told him that it seems like I just got over a cold over the weekend. And as for the fatigue at times it seems that even with 5-7 hours of sleep I can still take a couple hour naps in the afternoon.  Well he told me that he thinks it might be Mono, but when I looked up high leukocyte count it shows leukemia as a possiblity.  My question is if everything else was normal, and only my leukocyte count was high, what are the possibility that this is Leukemia? I am totally freaked out right now. The last time I had a  high leukocyte count I had my appendix removed. When they went in to remove it there was nothing wrong with it. They figured it was a infection and gave me antibiotics after the surgery.  This has really got me worried. I also smoke too and I am 29 years old.

I have stage 2a Hodgkins (MC) and just completed 3 cyces of ABVD. i had a CT scan which has revealed the largest tunmor in my chest which measured 4cm by 4cm has reduced to 1.6cm by 1.6cm. I have three other sites namely my supraclavicular nodes which i can still feel but they also have greatly reduced in size.

My question is this a significant reduction in size and should i be looking for a PET scan to see if there is any activity. I am just concerned that Hodgkins can leave residual mass and they may not be need for further chemo. (Wishful thinking!!!) 

Advice is appreciated

                I've been having issues with my back for about a year and a half now.  I had MRIs recently of all three areas of my spine, the only abnormal result being spinal stenosis at around C5-C7.  For about the last month and a half I've been experiencing more soreness in my neck and shoulder on my right side.  The soreness from the shoulder seems to be from my shoulder blade to my triceps area mostly, with a bit of tingling and decreased sensation in that arm.  I work out and have joined a softball league this spring/summer, so the shoulder soreness could be from that.  I just worry that there's something else going on.  I know there is more to my problem than the stenosis and I would just like to rule out Cancer.  

I don't have any of the typical symptoms of lymphoma.  If it were early, would I have those symptoms?

                My son has had a lymph node behind his left ear since he was 2 months. but the lymph node has been enlarged for over 5 weeks now. When I went to the doctor, he said he didn't like the size of it and measured it. It is 2cm by 2cm, which in my eyes it looks bigger than that. He is sending us on tuesday at the childrens hospital for an ultrasound and some blood work. What could this be? He hasn't been sick at all since he's been born. He has very mild cradle cap and very mild exzema on his face. But when I talked to my friends with their babies who had cradle cap, they didn't have large lymph nodes at all. So i'm a bit concerned..Any suggestions or what this could be?

I'm new to this so bare with me.  I have had swollen lymph nodes through my neck and groin for years now that have caused me a great deal of anxiety, recentaly my gland in my throat swelled up after a sinus infection and still hasnt gone down a month later, it has become awlfully uncomfortable.  I don't really have many symptoms other than the swelling just general discomfort.  I went for an ultrasound on my whole neck yesterday (which always makes m nervous to watch and know nothing about what your seeing)  the lady asked me if i had a history of thyroid problems in my family which could very well be a standard question they ask but I don/t and im not over weight or super skinny or anything like that.  I do have eczema.  I am so concerned about the gland staying swollen and only on one side....could anyone tell me what this could be or if youve experienced the same symptoms.

                I am  37 year old male in relatively good health except for some back issues. About a year ago while taking a shower, I noticed my right armpit felt slightly larger than my left. I could not feel a noticeable lump or anything like that, but I could clearly feel that the armpit is kind of puffy whereas my left armpit feels flatter. My question is if a lymph node is swollen in the armpit would it be felt as a palpable lump or could it manifest itself as the puffiness I'm describing? My armpit does not feel hard or painful, just soft and puffy.It has remained this way for over a year and has not gotten any bigger or smaller. Could this be lymphoma or just something less serious. Any feedback would be greatly appreciated. This has me really concerned. Thanks.

                Typically I am a very healthy 31 yr old female.  I eat really good food and exercise regularly.
I have had a nodule which I thought was on my thyroid but the dr I just saw said that it was not my thyroid and that it was in my lymph node.  It is on the left sid about middle of my neck and about the size of a bean-ish.  I noticed it last fall and it did not bother me.  The nodule itself does not hurt but when I swallow certain things my throat hurts in that certain spot and I can feel it pushing on something possibly my vocal cords or esophagus.  It is bothersome but not terrible.
I have had night sweats to where I woke up soaking wet.  I am sooooo unbelievably fatigued.  I have a mild fevers for no reason.  99.9, 99.6 or 99.8.
All doctors look at me and say I look to healthy to have something wrong with me.  It is really frusterating.  Also, they say no one in my family has had it so I wont.

They did another cat scan today that showed swelling of the brain, which I dont understand why... the surgery was in his chest and shouldn't have any affect on his brain. unless something went wrong during surgery,maybe a blood clot?. The thing is im not sure why they havent done an e.e.g to see if his brain is having any activity at all.. because im beginning to think he might be brain dead?..

basically Im worried if maybe the doctors aren't telling me the truth or at least the whole truth. With the way I'm describing things what do you think could be going on?

                this all started i believe with a lump on my left testicle, which had been increasing in size and swell when irritated for the last 4 to 6 years, this lump turned into a cluster of larder lumps about o.25 cm each, about 2 years agao i noticed a lump on the back of my neck the seemed to bother me at the same times as my testicle, this bothered me a bit, but now ive progressed from being curious to afraid,  ive recently (over the last week) developed several swollen spots (glands/lymph nodes???) behind my left ear and behind my jaw under my chin and down the left side of my neck. Its painful constantly and im dizzy , i also almost passed out the other day for about 15 minutes my vision went blurry and grey and i was unbelievably dizzy it was almost like a dream or hallucination, i got really warm  and it was kinda hard to breath. There is a cluster of swollen lumps clustered around each other in my neck all about 0.5 to 1.0 cm in size, the one behind my ear is about 3 cm in size (what can be felt of it that is, its petruding from behind the left ear almost pointy in shape) there are 2 next to that about 1.5 cm in size that lay on my skull behind my ear, and one hehind my jaw thats almost an inch in diameter it causes a large visible lump when i look to the right. these are all on the left side and its getting bad enough i dont like to turn my head. I also have several like 4 or 5 swollen glands on each side of my groin. I dont have a family doctor So i am going to have to go into the hospital for this, Im 25 years young and from the symptoms and what ive read it leads me to believe i may have lymphoma or cancer, i dont even know what lymphoma is.

                Ok, sounds like I’m not alone here. I too am a 30-year old male in good physical shape (that I know of) but I have had swollen lymph nodes appearing all over my body for the past 10 years or so. I first noticed the ones in my groin area where I can feel 5-6 almond-sized ones on each side of my groin when lying down. I was told by my general physician that this is normal in “thin” people.

I admit that I might be a bit of a hypochondriac, always checking myself out for irregularities. But, a few years ago I started noticing all these other lymph nodes which feel to me to be enlarged. I can easily feel one in the middle of my chest about the size of a small almond, one on the back (left side) of my neck about the size of a pea, another on the back (left side) of my head about the size of a pea, one directly behind my right ear lobe (right next to the ear itself) about the size of a pea. I have had these for I would guess around 3-4 years.

More recently (about 2 months ago), the lymph nodes under my left underarm have become enlarged. They don’t hurt, they are just annoying because it feels like someone has their finger in my underarm. None of my “swollen” lymph nodes have ever hurt, but I can definitely feel them under the skin by touch. I have never had any other symptoms of illness. I never get sick, I have plenty of appetite and energy, (actually an avid weight lifter and runner). I’ve had a fever maybe twice in my life, no night sweats, nothing.

I have had multiple complete blood counts including white blood count and everything has always come back normal. I’ve also had a chest x-ray for something unrelated and nothing appeared on that I assume.

I’m baffled and of course fear the worse, HIV, lymphoma, or some other type of cancer, but again never a symptom and apparently in great health according to my yearly physical results. Should I pursue a specialist for this, or just let it go?

I should put a side note here that for roughly the same period of time (about 10 years) I’ve had 2 badly decayed teeth. Both developed abscesses on the gum in the past year and I had one tooth removed (on the left side) about 4 months ago. It is completely healed now. I still have the other decayed tooth on the right side which is scheduled to be removed in a couple of weeks. (Life lesson, always take care of your teeth!) Anywho, is it possible that having these 2 decaying teeth for so long has caused all the lymph nodes in my body to become swollen. And if my blood stream was infected that badly to cause all the swollen lymph nodes, wouldn’t that have shown up on my CBC’s?

                My first time here.  I was looking up reasons why I might have bleeding gums.  I am fastidious about keeping my teeth brushed and have always had very healthy gums and teeth.  The past 8 months I have suddenly lost weight of 34 pounds without trying which is unusual for me.  I've had abdominal pain mainly on the L side but occasionally on the right side.  I've also had nausea daily and vomiting which is usually a morning occurrence about 4 times a week.  It all started with constipation last July which was shocking since I've lived with diarrhea  (2x a week) for the past 20 years.  The vomiting and nausea started in October and then I struggled for 3 or 4 months with a loss in appetite which is still a struggle.  I do feel like a little bit of my appetite has come back, but I still can't eat as much as I used to.  I feel full so quickly.  Within the past two weeks my gums have started bleeding, my feet have been swelling to which I even took pictures of my feet to make sure I wasn't seeing thing.  First thing in the morning, they're normal size....then by afternoon they are swollen.    Also some nights I will be so itchy I will break the skin, I've itched so hard.   And I have been having some terrible sweating some nights where I will soak my pajamas.  It's not every night, but it has been several over the past 3 weeks.  I've also been struggling with back pain on the upper right side and sometimes on the left.  I also have developed 4 tiny pin sized red marks on my torso and chest, foot which I thought was a bit weird.  All that aside, I have really been struggling with major fatigue so much that I feel like I have mono at times.  Other times it's not so bad.  
I've had every test you can think of~colonoscopy, ultrasound of the abdomen & pelvis, two CT scans of the abdomen and pelvis, mammogram, brain CT scan, EGD, upper GI with a Small Bowel Follow-through, HIDA scan, left leg ultrasound, stool sample checking for Giardia and blood work for H. Pylori bacteria.  IAll my tests have come back clear.  I'm scheduled for a capsule endoscopy next week.  I've had my blood work done which was showing everything normal until just recently there was a change.  My urine showed that it is yellow and cloudy with a WBC esterase 2+ in it.  It showed also traces of ketones and that crystals are present.  I don't know what crystals or ketones mean.  It showed that my WBC count went from 4.7 in February to an 11.5 at the end of May.  I was under the impression that the WBC count of 11.5 really isn't anything to worry about.  I do not have a urinary tract infection as I have no pain, no straining or gripping or burning. I know that if a UTI is left untreated, it only gets worse.  Well, today I am still having no struggles with any kind of UTI so I can only assume that I don't have one.  So, I know there has to be another reason as to why I have blood in my urine.  

My maternal uncle died from leukemia and my maternal grandmother died of kidney disease.  Can anyone give me suggestions as to what they think is wrong with me or what I can do next?   Do I have some kind of little kidney thing going on?  I'm feeling desperate to get better so that I can look after my little girls better.  Oh yeah, I have also been faithfully taking nutritional supplements (like an Ensure drink) daily and some extra vitamins of B6, B12, Bcomplex 50, Garlic, Fish oil, Magnesium and Activated Charcoal gel caps.

Anti-Thyroid Antibody Profile: 

Anti-Thyroidperoxidase    3.8                Ref Range= 0-5.5 
Anti-Thyroglobulin           17.3 (H)              Ref Range=0-4.0

Eosinophils      5.85  (H)                        Ref Range= 0.00-3.0

                Hi All

I have had painful lymph nodes under my jaw and infront of my ears both sides for about a week,
Also feel some discomfort under armpits.

I cannot locate any swollen glands.  I have been to the doctor and he didnt know what was wrong.
I have been regularly monitoring my temperature, which is normal.

The pain is a dull ache, and I feel throbbing and pulsating in the nodes under my jaw.

Today I have a very sore left side of neck, I dont know if it is more lymph pain or muscle pull. But very sore.

What should I do?  Doctor can't help me and the pain is still there after a week.

I have been very stressed and had anxiety all week, and this isn;t helping me calm down.  I dont know if this lymph pain can be associated with stress??

I had the same thing about 6 years ago, which I put down to stress at the time, but it only lasted a few days back then,.

P.S.no other symptoms, no colds, cuts etc.

It is hard to read her handwriting, but I can make out two of them CBC and ESR. 

Does this mean I have nothing to worry about? 

Tonight I noticed pea like bumps on the other side of her throat

                My 5yr old daughter has had very enlarged lymph nodes for over 6mths. At first, it was just a 3-4cm cervical node on the right side. She now has a 1cm node on the left side, just above the clavicle. She has ongoing belly pain. She has had numerous blood test. Always showing lymphocytosis. Her lymp count is now up to 62% (normal is up to 40%). When they did a CT scan due to belly pain, they found many messentary and retroperitneal lymph nodes. Mono, Mycoplasma, and Cytomegalovirus labs are all negative. I am very concerned at this point. We are scheduled to see the surgeon June 4th for a lymph node biopsy. Should I worry about a lukemia?

                Do I have to worry if my BETA 2-MICROGLOBULIN was elevated at 3.06.
I have had Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma 2 times the second time with this cancer, it back with a vegenance, but I was able to succeed and remain in remission for 10 yrs so far. Now the marker has been creeping up slowly from 2006 and now abnormal. 
Thank you.

                Hi everyone.  I have multifactorial anemia and MGUS.  I am having a bone marrow biopsy on Wed.  I had some labs last week, and understand that the free Kappa and free Lambda serum levels are a relatively new thing.  I am not sure but it may be related to Multiple Myeloma, so forgive me if this is the wrong forum.  My free Kappa level  is 19.3 with the normal values being 3.3-19.4.  So you can see that I am on the high edge of normal.  Does this mean anything?  Am I now more likely to have MM or something show up on the bone marrow?  I'm sure the physician will tell me but I am curious now!  Any info would help.  Thanks in advance.

                Dear Doctor, dear everyone,

I come to you asking for help, because the doctors I visited so far do not really want to think over my problem. They spend about 1 minute with my issue all the time then they only ""guessed"" something. 

6 months ago I noted a bigger size lymphnode on the right side of my neck. It is 1,1 cm, so visible. Some time later I also found 2x0.5 cm swollen lymphnodes under my chin actually on both sides. I feel since then almost every day a little pain especially at the 1,1 cm lymphnode. The smaller ones are sometimes bigger, sometimes smaller. The bigger one is 1,1 cm from the beginning, it does not become smaller or bigger. I feel it quite hard, that makes me anxious.

My first ENT doctor said that the lymphnode is not so big, we should let it there, and later it will go away by itself. We cannot do anything against it, it is because of some virus or bacterium.

We made blood tests. The number of lymphozytes is higher than the normal, but not much higher. We tested it at the beginning and several months later again, but the value is still high. I don't know if it will ever goes down, or if this is healthy that this value is increased so long time.. I am concerned about this already :(

- Lymphozytes 3.1 (reference: 1 - 2.9)

The other thing they found, that the EBV IgG-Ak is higher than normally. The lab states that I had before EBV virus, but now I am over, this is why this value is high. My other ENT doc said, this can also cause the swollen lymphnode. But why is it swollen still after 6 months (when I don't have that virus already)??

- EBV-CA IgM-Ak negative
- EBV-CA IgG-Ak 403 	(normal <20) U/ml
- EBV-NA IgG-Ak positive

All other values in the blood tests are normal. (I think that is why the docs are not really concerned about the whole issue)

I went to MRT about my neck, they also said that they don't see any dangerous, maybe a virus or bacteria.

Generally, I feel healthy, even when I noticed first this lymphnode 6 months ago, I was not sick. It was just suddenly there, and it is there since then.

After some time the ENT doc gave me antibiotics, I took that for one week, and I think it just became worse (at that time I started to feel the smaller nodes)

The ENT doctor sent me to thyroid diagnosis, where they did blood test, which showed increased TPO 107 (norm <50U/ml) but other things were normal. They diagnosed preclinical hypothyreot and gave me thyroxin medicament for that. But they and also the ENT doctor said that this is not related to my swollen lymphnode. (So I don't take this medicament as I don't have any symphtom).

What do you think, is that something dangerous? Is that normal that I have these swollen lymphnodes for 6 months? What should I do? How long I will have this small pain in my neck? Any similar experience? 

Many thanks!!
Johnny

                Hi I had a CT and a mammogram in the radiologist's findings were large billateral axillary adenopathy and the mammogram found the same both recommended PET Scan.  Findings in PET scan is extensive clusters of lymphnodes in multiple chains in the head and nec, axillae, iliac, inguinal and femoral regions which shows abnormal intermediate to high level FDG accumulation.  In the chest portion of the study, both right and left axillae show clusters of lymph nodes with abnormal intermediate high-level FDG activity in the right axilla SUV max of 4.11 and in the left SUV max of 3.8.  Does this means i may have some sort of cancer?

                Hi, I've just experienced a lump on the right side of my groin with a pulse so i would assume it to be a lymph node. About 4 days ago after completing 3 sets of sit-ups I came upon this lump. At first I did not know what to presume perhaps just a strain of some sort. Then earlier today I felt another lymph on the other side. Not as hard though as the first one I felt, this one was more tender and a lot deeper in the flesh, The initial one though tend to rest on the surface of my groin. It was about as small as a seed the ones usually seen in oranges i guess. I have not felt any pain nor were there any blemishes on the surface of the skin. No Symptoms of fever or lack of appetite. I'm just curious as of what could cause this? I read something about swollen lymph nodes from infections could lead to Lymphoma or in some rare cases a tumor. I would appreciate any reply or word of advise regarding this topic. I hope to educate myself a lot more about this experience.

                am 36y old female. Last year things turned when I starting having fatigue, dizziness, serve headache, and nausea. In addition to that I have really bad allergies which gives me constant sinuses and swelling (I live in a State which is worst for allergy). I have had H. Pyloric and ulcer before. I also have acid reflux. My WBC range was from 2.0 through 3.5 over the last year. My neutrophils were low, lymphocytes were high, and esinophils were high. I was told last year that I had neutropenia, Mono-kissing disease by another doctor, and another told me that I had had a viral that was unidentifiable. This continued until this year, I was referred to a Hematologist. 
My Appointment with the Hematologist was yesterday. He informed me that it was normal for African American to have low WBC, however he could not determined the cause of the headache and fatigue. He informed me that many physicians do not realize that the level of WBC in an African American is different from that of a Caucasian. He told me that he looks at my blood under the microscope and it looks normal to him. However, upon leaving his office, I started having dizziness. Can someone tell me if this is more than just being an African American with low WBC?

                About nine months ago I discovered a hard painless lump that feels much like a dried kidney bean under my skin on the front of my shoulder about an inch from my armpit.  It does not move and seems attached to the muscle under it. 

I showed it to my Dr, who said ""thats interesting"" and nothing else.  There are now more small bumps popping up around it, like dried peas in size and the first one is slightly larger, when showed to the Dr he once again said ""thats interesting"" and told me to get a mamogram.  (Considering the placement will not be shown on a mamogram and I have found no lumps in my breasts along with the fact he did not give me a referral for one that is not easy to do)

In the past year I have lost 45 pounds due to loss of appetite and nausea and I do wake with my hair drenched, but not all over night sweats and don't feel like I have any itching that is more than normal.  (I have very dry skin and itch all the time anyway).

I do not run fevers, not even when having a severe infection (had a ruptured appendix with no temperature or elevated white blood count) so I am not running fevers, but I do have strange hot and cold at the same time feelings, like I am burning up and in front of a freezer at the same time.

Should I just ignore it since my Dr does not seem troubled or should I try to see an Oncologist to have it evaluated if one will take me without a referral?

                Hi, I don't know much about lymphoma but have heard that having an enlarged lymph node for a while is often one of the first signs if not the only one. I've had a an enlarged lymph node for about a year or more on the right side of my neck near the back of my jaw. It's about 3/4 of an inch long and maybe a half inch wide usually though right now it is a tad bigger because I'm fighting off some sinus congestion. I haven't thought much of this enlarged lymph node for awhile because I doesn't hurt and isn't tender at all except it is sometimes a little bit when I'm sick, but when I'm not sick it's not tender and I can always move it around. Also for the past week my right ear has felt irritated around the top of the ear and feels like I have extra skin because of swelling but it's hard to tell and don't know if thats connected to anything or not. I mainly want to know if this enlarged lymph node in my neck seems related to lymphoma or not and if I did have lymphoma wouldn't the my enlarged lymph node continue to get bigger and bigger as well as other lymph nodes start to get bigger or not? Lastly in my groin I have one maybe two lymph nodes or what feel like lymph nodes that seem long like maybe 3/4 of and inch or so and skinny and they've been like that for awhile, probably since I can remember, but wanted to know if that's normal or if I should be conserned and get this checked out as well.

If I could get some helpful comments from people that know about lymphoma and could answer my questions I would greatly appreciate it. I'm hoping this is all nothing, but I rather be safe then sorry so any help I could get I would be grateful for, thank you all in advance!

user_793023,jzerosh,/posts/Leukemia-and-Lymphoma-/possible-lymphoma-and-doc-issue/show/785798,possible lymphoma and doc issue,"
                It all started about a year ago, my girlfriend noticed a lump in my groin area, i then noticed it.. but thought since i felt one on the other side, it was probably normal(wrong), and waited about 6 months.. since then i have been having stomach problems(trouble taking a #2), yet im not constipated.. i told my doctor all of this and he felt the lymph nodes and said they were swollen.. and he scheduled a colonoscopy, i had that done, and he found a area of ""abnormal tissue"" and had it biopsied, and tatoo'd. Some time during this procedure i woke up in the middle, and figured something went wrong (eg bowel perferation) or whatnot.. and then i was back out again, and they made me wait for 3 bags of saline.

After all of that, my problems got worse. Their was now not only what felt like blockage while trying to take a #2, but a sharp pain in my right side(after googling it seemed like apendicitis), i had an issue twice where i was seated prior, and when i stood up, my side hurt really bad, and felt as if a balloon of hot water went everywhere(and then i got really dizzy, almost passed out), this happened twice in about 2 weeks. Their was then blood in my stool, and sharp pains while trying to go, doc said it was all in my head, and when i asked about the colonoscopy, and why i woke up.. he said he had done hundreds of these procedures, and that it was all in my head since i had a history of depression(i know what is in my head or not).

So he scheduled a CT scan of my abdomen and pelvis with and without contrast, and also an oral contrast. The results came back and it says on the sheet that my liver, spleen adrenal glands pancreas, and kidneys are unremarkable. But it does state as follows:

conclusion:
#1.  increased number and size of retroperitoneal and mesenteric lymph nodes, differential diagnosis includes mesenteric adenitis. clinical correlation is advised. a follow up study is also advised to rule out any possibility of malignancy.

#2 possible urinary bladder artifact from urinary contrast jets excreted into the urinary bladder versus a urinary bladder mass. the next step for further evaluation is an ultrasound study of the urinary bladder. a cystoscopy may also be useful.

But at this appointment the docter says he thinks i have non-hodgkins lymphoma.

I have yet been given an antibiotic to rule out infection, the nodes in my groin at certain times seem to get really tight(or feels that way) and i can feel my heart beating through it, even while not touching it.. also i have a swollen/very sore to the touch spot on my lower right of my back.

My doctor did a blood test before this and didnt tell me anything about my white blood count, or anything else to see if its alarming, but he did tell me my hemoglobin was above normal, and very good.

I'm 22, kind of still in shock about possible cancer, my appointment with a general surgeon is about a month away, and my lymph nodes are really bothering me, i'm afraid im going to pass out and get really hurt, or what not.

Any ideas, clues, or anything =p i'm so stressed.. just reading everything i can..

Oh, theirs also another node(or something) much smaller but almost directly below the lymph node, and its hard. i'm not sure when it appeared, but it seems recent.

Do you think cancer is the cause, or has anyone else had the same issue, do you think i should be on antibiotics, etc.. thanks in advance, i know i just ranted alot.. but my doctor is hard to talk with, and im just worried because i put this off, i really had no clue it could be so serious, as it has not before bothered me.. if it wasnt for my girlfriend i wouldnt have noticed them until now, and i still dont understand why everything seemed to start at once, trouble going to the bathroom, colonoscopy, bad pain/more apparent nodes, etc. any help is appreciated, thanks again for your time.

                Hi, I recently posted here about a lump in the back of my neck that I have had for about 6 months. An ultrasound showed that the lump is made up of two enlarged lymph nodes. I'm going to have another ultrasound next month to compare for growth. 

About four days ago, I woke up with the lump much harder and larger than it usually is. I made an appointment for early next week to have it checked out. However, in the last few days the lump has returned to its ""normal"" size that it has been for 6 months. I'm assuming that this rapid growth/shrinking was some sortof of infection, and I'm thinking about canceling my appointment, and just waiting for the ultrasound next month. Does this sound like the right thing to do, or is there any reason for my doctor to re-examine the lymph nodes after they have gone through changes? Thanks a lot!

                About three weeks ago, I discovered a lump on the back, right side of my neck.  Worried, I went to the doctor who told me I was fine, but to keep an eye on it.  He did some blood work, which all came back clear.

The lump is hard, unmovable, and entirely painless.

Over the next week after that doctor's visit, I began feeling extremely fatigued and I have had headaches every single day since. Also, my skin on my back, right side became extremely itchy.  I decided to go to a new doctor for a second opinion.  He did more blood work, including an HIV test, all of which came back fine.  He prescribed me an antibiotic and told me to call if the symptoms continued.  

A few days after that visit, a rash appeared across my back, mainly on the right side, and moved across my stomach.  It is itchy and painful.  I went back to the doctor who informed me I have shingles.  He gave me a prescription for Valtrex, and told me to call on Monday.  If I am still feeling this poorly then, he wants to run a CT scan and biopsy the lump.

So my question really is how worried should I be?  I am a 24 year old male.  I don't smoke, drink, and I exercise regularly, and I eat right.  It is worrisome to have a shingles outbreak at my age?  Any responses would be helpful, and thanks in advance for the help.

                Here is some background: Last Thursday, my son was sent in for a CT due to vomiting for 5 days, some abdominal pain, fevers for over 2mths and wt loss.The Ct showed 80-100 mesenteric and retroperitineal lymph nodes measuring up to 2cm in size. The impression on the report : CONSIDERATION SHOULD BE GIVEN TO LYMPHOMA. We were immediately sent up to a Children's Hospital in Toledo, ohio. They ran some blood work. He had atypical lymphocyte, elevated uric acid and his LDH was borderline high. (normal is up to 235 and he was 233) Oncology came in for a consult and found out he has also had horrid night sweats and extreme fatigue. They were very concerned. Did another CT and found not as many lymph nodes as the first scan (they were able to keep the contrast down this time) but still showing prodominent lymph nodes measuring up to 2cm in size. He has some swelled lymph nodes through his neck, but chest was clear. No masses either. They were a little less concerned at this point and chose to do a bone marrow biopsy just out of one side and not doing a lymph node biopsy. The bone marrow biopsy came back shwoing he has a mycoplasma in his marrow, which is rare we have been told. No lukemia or lymphoma. He is starting on 6mths of zithromax and nystatin to help fight this infection. Our family doc is concerned with the bone marrow biopsy. He really believes we need a lymph node biopsy. Both him and the radiologist called us and said they would go for a 2nd opinion and have a lymph node biopsy. 

So here are my questions:
1. Is an early Lymphoma even detectable in bone marrow? 
2. Would you go for a 2nd opinion on having a lymph node biopsy?
3. Is there anything else I should know or do?

Any advice is appreciated. Thanks!!

                My 27 yr. old daughter went to her family doctor earlier this week. She has been having a strange headache the past month. Rather constant and intense. That is why she went to the doctor. The doctor ran bloodwork and immediately found out she was anemic. Then, the bloodwork was sent off for a more extensive exam. The doctor called my daughter yesterday with the results. The doctor stated to my daugter that cancer cells were found in her bloodwork. My daughter's other symptoms are extreme fatigue, aching joints, a full filling in her stomach area and no appetite. My daughter never complains unless she is truly sick. And normally she is full of energy. I am trying to be very upbeat and hopeful for my daughter's sake. But to be honest, we are very scared right now. My daughter goes back to the doctor Tuesday of next week for further bloodwork. And very possibly a CT scan.  Cancer does run heavily in our family. I am a 20 yr. cancer survivor. My father died with bladder cancer. I also had 2 grandfathers to die from cancer. My daughter did have a cancer scare about 6 yrs. ago. It was precancerous and of the cervix. She did have a procedure done to stop these precancerous cells. I had the same thing done to me many years ago. But, I ended up having cancer of the cervix anyway. I have been researching on the net about my daughter's symptoms, the anemia and the cancerous cells in her bloodwork. I keep coming across possibly leukemia. I don't want to make any diagnosis, as I am not qualified to do so. But, I am a mother and I can't help but worrying so. I do though know, that cancer cells showing up in the blood is not normal whatsoever. Any input would be so deeply appreciated. Please be upfront if need be, as I will not be offended. Thank you very much.

My question is two part:  can something be done about this and;
the biggest question is that we were warned that when he reached his late 20's to early 30's he could be very inclined to have other types of cancer, including a reoccurance of the ALL.  He had enormous amounts of cranial and testicular radiation and was on a 51 drug protocol of mostly experimental drugs (at the time) given in dosages that are exceedingly high compared to what is being used now.  What do we look for and or test for?

                My son is four and has a little lump on the right side of  his neck, it doesn't hurt him only when I move it around sometimes.Its the size of a pea, but he seems to be healthy, he eats good, plays, sleeps well, gets common colds and stuff, but gets well right away! I have had doctors tell me sometime its normal for young ones have this, but I'm getting worried cause latley I have been hearing about Leukemia and Lymphoma links! The lump is soft, so maybe its just fatty tissue or something? Its funny cause a few years back I had a lump under my breast and had it check out , the doctor did a biopt said it was nothing and it went away and never came back! Am I just getting worried over nothing or should I be alarmed? I don't know if I always believe some doctors! Also my husband and I are strong believers in alternitive medicine! What do think I should do???

                I am a 36 year old female and today is 04-01-09. During the first week of 02-09 I went to the doctor with a swollen and painful lymph node on the right side of my neck. I was diagnosed with a bladder infection of which the doctor didn't think would or should have caused the swollen gland. I was treated with Keflex 7 days all was better. On 03-17 I had a colonoscopy with Hemm.banding.I awoke with sever bladder pain. I visited the ER that same night and the urine test was inconclusive due to the meds from the surgery that day but I was treated with Bactrim 10 days..I have since found I did not have a bladder infection. I finished the Bactrim antibiatioc on 03-27 and two days later I have painful swollen lymph node on the Left side of my neck. I also have been having night sweats while aggravating have not been terribly severe nor every night. Oh I also have autoimmune disorders, ITP and had to have a hysterectomy due to endometriosis. To date I have had six surgeries some minor some major.

                hi i am a 29 year old female with enlarged lymph nodes everywhere.  i have been trying to get an answer but with no luck. i have a few questions that i can't find answers to.
what is a lymph node specialist Dr called?
what are reactive lymph nodes/treatment?
what is thickened core disease and its treatment?
i have enlarged nodes in both sides of my neck under both arms in both sides of groins in front of throat under jaw and chin in front of my ears and not sure if i have a few above my tail bone, they feel the same.
most of these nodes feel rubbery and some are quite large, however a few in my groins feel really hard like stones.  i was referred to ent by gp because my throat always looks sore but feels ok to me and i have had hoarseness for a few months now. the ent dr had a quick look up my nose and down my throat and sent me to breast dr for lump under arms,  who did ultra sound just under arms and performed a ultrasound guided core biopsy.  this is what he said in his report   normal breast tissue with prominent lymph nodes in both axillae all of which have preserved fatty hilum but with thickened core disease.  these features are benign reactive type pattern. core biopsy was performed on the largest palpable node in the right axillae and subsequent histology has revealed features consistant with a reactive lymph node and no evidence of malignancy.   he goes on to say he thinks i have globus pharyngeus with my throat problems and tells me to go back to gp if i get new problems.
although he said there was no evidence of malignancy in that particular node i am worried about the other nodes,  most of them are at least 2cm in size.  i have other symptoms too that the drs just dont seem to listen too.
i have frequent night sweats although i feel cold all day i wake up between 4.30 and 6.30 am feeling hot and having damp hair from sweating.  i feel really tired all the time and this is made worse by eating, a few mouth fulls and all i want to do is fall asleep and have done a few times at the dining table, the dr says i am tired because i have a busy lifestyle.  my appetite is very poor i only eat one meal a day as i never feel hungry and it feels like there is a tablet/pill stuck in my throat in this is made worse by eating hard foods. my weight not decreasing now but did go down quite dramatically when all these lumps appeared 2 years ago, its taken me this long to get back to a healthy weight and my appetite only changed recently. 
i seem to get sent to ent and breast clinic and then still have no answers.  does anyone know what this could be?  what test/s should i ask for?  which scan is best?  
any help wpuld be gratefully appreciated
thank you in advance

                Hi 
I tak it I am being silly as noone has respondd to my query? Could someone please respond as I am worrying about this and do not want to go to my doctor if it just nothing and am worrying needlessly. The thing that makes me wonder if I have ben misdiagnosed with fibromyalgia is that they say it is moscoskeletal pain but I kep telling my doc I do not eel pain in the musces but my bones are really sore.

I have widespread chronic pain and have been diagnosed with fibromyalgia but I also have swollen large lumps under both my arms (between breast and underarms) and a recent blood test showed I had enlarged red blood cells. My GP though the enlarged red blood cells was because I was drinking too much alcohol but I don't and I am now wondering if I have been misdiagnosed with Fibromyalgia. My underarms feel as if someone has been holding me up under my arms and when I feel arnound I have quite a large lump under both my arms.

                Hello ,I hope someone can help.  I started to see a doctor for low white blood cells about 3mos. ago(been low for about 1-1/2yrs.), then she did a CT on my chest and found swollen lymph nodes in my lungs, she said the spot was in-between my breasts. I have pain there when I take deep breaths, laugh/cough to hard, SOB, & burning sensations all the time in that spot.  The thing is, its been like that for at least 8yrs. She wants me to have more blood work done & have another CT of the chest & adding a CT of the neck (I have many sore throats) in 3mos. Seeing as I've lived with this for so many yrs. I don't think there is any point to any more testing. Am I a right or am I way off?  Thank You!

                Hi, I've had a lump in the back of my neck for about six months. I went to my doctor last week and she said that she thought that it was a cyst, but she seemed fairly concerned and asked if I was experiencing symptoms that I know are associated with lymphoma (night sweats, weight loss, etc.). She ordered a CBC and an ultrasound, and said that I may have to get a biopsy depending on what the ultrasound found. I had the ultrasound this morning, and the technician said that I had two enlarged lymph nodes. She showed a doctor the scans while I waited and then came back and said that I could leave.

So my question is, what happens now? At the ultrasound appointment today, I assumed that if the doctor thought that the lymph nodes could signify lymphoma, I would have been told. Also, I had my blood work done about four business days ago, and I still haven't gotten any results back. I'm thinking that no news is good news, and I'd like to rule out lymphoma. Is it still possible that I may have a serious disease and for some reason have not been notified yet? Any insight would be greatly appreciated, thanks a lot!

Doctors have done numerous tests and all have come back normal.
I'm just kind of freaked out because my father past at 52 of leukemia, don't remember what kind.  Started out with low rbc though. 
I tend to drink heavy at least once per week 4-10 drinks on that single day (wine tasting day) and 0 to 4 on other days.
Doctors want to retest in about another month, but doesn't seem to concerned.  They did a smear also, was ok.

WBC COUNT (K/uL) 2.6 to 2.7 steady on 4 tests over a couple of weeks
NEUTROPHILS, ABSOLUTE, AUTOMATED COUNT (K/uL) 1.2 to 1.4

                Hello thank you for taking the time to read this and for any help/thoughts.

Im a 23 year old male and about 2 years ago now I was just randomly feeling my neck and noticed a small lump on the right side of my neck (about 3 inches directly below my ear) it is about 2cm across in size and quite flat. When I touch the edge of it it feels quite spongy and I guess a little slippery when I touch the edges as it moves around a little. It does not hurt to touch. I have had no bouts of colds, coughs, flu, exhaustion etc and have not had any other problems so in general my health has been excellent.

I did point out the lump to my Doctor a year ago and he said it was just a swollen lymph node and to come back if it got bigger or caused any pain. It hasn't affected my life or health so I kind of forgot about it until a few days ago when I just happened to feel the area again and it was still there it feels exactly the same as before and has not grown in size. The best way to describe it would be if I push down a little on the edge of it it seems to squish down a little and move a bit. It is quite soft probably like the feeling of the corner of your nose. 

I am just a little worried as it has been there now for over 2 years and can't help thinking it could be something more then jump a swollen lymph node as I have read lymph nodes swell to fight infections but I haven't had any for a long time. My other question as it has been there for like 2 years now wouldn't I have experienced other symptoms by now if it was something more serious?.

I am going to the Doctors this week to see what he says now. I know no one can give a proper diagnosis online but if anyone has had similiar or has any help or advice on what you think it could be would be great. Thank You.

                Hi,
Im  a 25 year old male and have discovered a small painless lump on my right side of my posterior cervical node.  It is a hard, rubbery, movable lump between .5 – 1 cm.  I first took notices of it about 3 months ago and have kept a close eye on it.  It has neither increase nor decreased in size.  Have not had any night sweats, fever, itching or any other symptoms except this lump.  I have concerns about the possibility of lymphoma but have very basic insurance that only covers hospital visits.  I was however able to consult a friend that is a physician.   He suggested that it’s a bit too small to worry about lymphoma and to wait to see if it gets bigger.  I understand that the only way to diagnose this definitively is if I get a biopsy but I would rather not have a 5000 medical bill if there is a low probability that is cancerous.   Anyone with advice on my situation please comment.  Thanks.

                For the past year I have been getting red patches on my neck, around my collarbone, and on my abdomen. You can see my other post for my other symptoms, but I was wondering if this could be related to my symptoms of enlarged lymph nodes and splenomegaly. The blotches themselves just appear randomly, and then go away to only come back again.

I also have a really itchy scalp and my back itches like crazy everyday without fail.

Any response to this would be helpful.

i also have pain where my spleen is and now also find that I have pain on the LRQ of my abdomen roughly 3-4 cm below the rib cage.

                I had an mri done of the neck and it showed scattered enlarged lymph nodes under 1 cm. which were described as non specific, non aggressive, no necrosis.  My ENT says that is no big deal.  Blood work does not show any infection.  I also had a thyroid ultrasound which showed a 7mm hypoechoic nodule.  The endo said that we would repeat the test again in 6 months to keep an eye on it.  Neither doctor seemed concerned about either finding.  Looking for opinions.

                I have recently went to see my general practitioner because of some lymph nodes that are swelling.  One is at the base of my scalp and the other is on the side of my neck(posterior cervial chain).  I have uncontrollable itching at night and it wakes me up and I did say something to her about this.  She prescribed me Vistaril to help with the itching, and there is no rash.  When the first node swelled my GP asked if I had a rash on my head and the answer was no, and now, I have the other node swelling and it is noticeable.  A full work up on my blood was ordered and I went this morning to the lab.  I am somewhat nervous because frankly, I feel like I am losing my mind with this.  I don't have an infection and I am tired all the time.  I am 36 but I heard that lymphoma affects people that is not really in my age group.  Should I be concerned?  Or am I just over reacting?  With the nodes being in different areas, that is what alarmed me.  Any advice.

                Hello! I am an 18 year old female. I first noticed a weird lump in my far right groin area (real close to where my leg attatches.). It doesn't hurt at all.  It felt like a grape under my skin and moved when i touched it. I had an appoitment with the dr for something else, and asked her what she thought it may be. You could feel it best when i stand and it is deeper when i lay down. She felt it for a long time, and said she wasn't sure what it was but thought it may be a lipoma. I had to have an ultrasound of my gallbladder and spleen, cuz i was and still am having persistant abdominal pain, and she told me to have the ultrasound tech take a pic of the lesion. The ultra sound tech could feel the lump with her hand, but couldn't seem to get a pic of it. And my dr called and said no gallstones, and everything looks fine. So im pretty sure the lump turned out to be nothing. This was very beg of April. I have had a lot of abdominal pain the last few months, and get very bloated at times. Ive tried cutting out dairy for a week, fake sweetners, etc. nothing improved except I do know I can't eat vegetables and fatty greasy foods give me alot of pain and huge budha belly. But the stomach could be totally unrelated im sure. Just thought I'd mention it. 

But the thing that was weird was slowly but surely more and more bumps started to appear. Now in that same groin area, there are 5 lumps, a few as big as grapes, some more like beans. There are none on my left side just my right. They all don't hurt at all, and some move more than others. 

then about two weeks, i found another lump on the left side of my neck, it feels about the size of a lima bean but thincker... again doesnt hurt. And it was never there before because i checked.

Last week I woke up with a really weird pain in my right elbow. It hurt to touch and move when it was straight but felt fine when it was bent. And right where the pain is, I now can feel a hard bean shaped lump. I thought it would go away, and the pain subsided, but the lump is still there. The last week I have had serious back pain, that really bothers me at times, it gets worse, then subsides a bit then returns to really bad pain. I also have just recently had weird chest pain on my right side when i breath deeply, and when i take big breaths, a very specific spot in my back hurts... its so weird! And my neck has been constantly painful and i used to never have aches and pains, especially in my back and neck. And now they feel every day like i slept on them wrong. My neck pain wakes me up and I'll be in the same postion I've always been in. 

And lastly the newest strange thing that has happened is: five days ago I went to bed normal, and when I got up in the morning and stood in the mirror getting dressed i had a weird rash only on my stomach. Well i dont even know if it is a rash... its red bumps placed all over my stomach. They don't itch, or sting, they are just there. They are relatively the same size, and are raised. I now today noticed a few more creeping on my back, and a few on my upper thighs. But I dont even feel them, they are just there. The last few days my skin has been itchy, not from the bumps just in general.

And ever since january i have experienced extreme fatigue. I sleep 12 hours at least at night, and nap through out the day, and as have become very weak. And the drs found I have slight hypothyroidism from hashimotos, and after starting that med, I had more energy then before, but its still not normal. I get extremly tired just from simply walking to class. And feel like i need a nap. 

So basically, what I am asking, is there by any chance, this all could be connected? and what do you suppose the lumps are? Do they sound like lymph nodes? I have not talked to my doctor at all because -besides the first groin lump-, because I really don't want her to think I'm a hypochondriac. Its just weird that the lumps are now increasing in numbers. i have no fever, just fatigue. Any insight to what all this may be? Thanks!!

                Hi everyone, I am new here. I have been reading different posts on this website for a few weeks now, and it has been very uplifting. 
     A week ago my doctor found an enlarged lymph node in my left clavicle. She sent me right over to the hospital for an ultrasound and an x-ray. I have a biopsy scheduled for Monday morning, and I am very afraid of the outcome because there's a very good chance it could be lymphoma. My question is, if it is lymphoma, what are my survival chances? I do not think that I have any other symtoms other than this enlarged node. I was running a low-grade fever for about a week, but I think it might have been from an upper respiratory infection that I just go over. Any thoughts anyone?

                I have had a swollen lymph node on the left side of my neck for about 12 years.  I have seen two doctors about it, both have said not to worry.  However, I am worried. :(

I first noticed the node right after I was really sick (had strep-throat multiple times when young).  The node was swollen and never really went back down to normal.  The node gets painful when I have a cold, and during allergy season (like now).  It gets bigger and then gets smaller.  Sometimes it is bigger in the morning and then is smaller by the time the evening comes.  I go for months without noticing it at all, even though it has never returned to normal.  It is not really ""hard"" and it is moveable.  Yes, I am concerned about lymphoma, the only other symptom I have of lymphoma is night sweats.  However, I also have PCOS, and the night sweats only started after I began medication for the PCOS.   The night sweats are cyclic and only happen two to three days before menstruating.

I am just curious if it is possible for a lymph node to never return to normal, and what I should do about it?

                I just started seeing a naturopathic dr. and he requested that I go to my drs. and gather as much lab work as possible.He also did a full CBC and urine.  According to him, I have iron deficiency anemia, adrenal insufficiency, acidic blood and I noticed a pattern of high RDW.  He has been treating me with iron, adrenal suppliments, and various other suppliments.  Now I'm showing a bacterial infection in my urinary tract with protein and trace blood.

He doesn't seem concerned about the RDW count which is alway 15.6 +.  My dad had myelodysplasia and I keep running across that and possible Lupus.  Had an ANA test years ago that said it was borderline.

Sick, scared and need answers if possible.

                I don't know if I am at the right place to help answer my questions or not.  But I have to try.  Okay, after many things...my doctor has now told me that my White Blood Cell count in my urine is high.(29)per hpf.  Also that my Hemorcit and hemoglobin are elevated.  But it may be nothing.  So I am so confused.  How can it be nothing when I feel so horrible. 

Here is what is happening to me...I noticed a soft lump by my left kidney a year ago. They call it a hypoechoic mass. I have extreme fatigue.  About once every 2 weeks I run a fever of 99-101.2 for a day, with terrible joint and bone aches then it all goes away by morning.  Now I am experiencing shortness of breath daily it gets worse with laying down.  So you see, I am not feeling well at all and I have been doctoring for a year and still have no straight answers.  Part of the problem is right in the middle of some testing being done my doctor left the practice and it took 4 months to get back in.  Then the new doctor had to start over.  If you can help me make any sense of this, please help!!!

                I recently discovered the connection between a balanced translocation of chromosomes 11 and 17 (q23; q21) and AML. I am wondering - does this mean that someone with that exact translocation and breakpoint - t(11;17) (q23;q21) will definately develop AML? If not, how likely is it? Also, if a person has the same balanced translocation of 11 and 17 but with the breakpoints slighlty different (q23;q11.5) how likely is that to make a difference in predicting the occurence of AML? Finally, why wold someone have a CVS test that found t(11;17) (q23;q21) and then a karyotype show t11;17) (q23;q11.2)? The report stated, ""The breakpoiint on the chromosome 17 long arm differs slightly from that listed for the CVS; this most likely represents the higher banding resolution obtained on the blood sample."" So which is the correct one? Any help will be appreciated!

                I have had the most painful lymph nodes on the left of my throat for about 3 months now. I am not sick and not tired. I have a history of skin cancer and I am worried that something serious is going on since my node is swollen.
Sometimes I feel this sharp pain in my throat as if there is a cut in my throat. I can't swallow anything. It takes drinking hot fluids for the sever pain in the throat to go away. What is going on?

                Hello, I need a bit of advice.  I've been concerned about my health for quite a while, but due to extreme anxiety I'm just now getting around to attempting to figure it out.  I am obsessing a bit about my symptoms, most of the people I know think I should not be concerned.

More than a year ago I noticed a large lump in my neck, just under my jaw near the carotid artery.  Later I noticed one just above my collar bone.  I did a fair bit of research, realized they were probably lymph nodes and after a fair bit of dreading went in to see my GP.  At the time I needed quite a lot of dental work taken care of, so my doctor assumed that was the cause.  He set me up with a course of antibiotics and wanted to see me after the dental work had been complete.  I let my anxiety get the best of me again though and didn't go back in until last week.

He felt my nodes, and noted the largest by my carotid artery was likely an inch or two long.  He ordered complete blood work, and when the preliminary came back all fine decided he'd set me up with a consultation with an ENT, for a biopsy.  I had implied I'd really like to have a biopsy done.  

On Friday I saw the ENT.  He felt the nodes and thought the one under my jaw near the carotid artery was maybe 1.5 to 2cm.  The one by my collar bone was .5 to 1cm.  He wasn't concerned at all and was ready to let me go on my way.  I wasn't entirely convinced these nodes were this small, the largest feels much bigger than 2cm to me...  As such I sort of went into panic mode and asked if he could possibly do a CT scan, or a biopsy just for peace of mind.  Because of the location of the nodes he wasn't comfortable doing a biopsy, he mentioned possible nerve damage from removing the node near my collar bone.  He did however agree to set me up with a CT scan, which I had the same day.

I am to see the ENT again tomorrow to discuss the results of the CT scan, which I'm worried about for a variety of reasons.  Knowing the exact size of these nodes should be useful I'd think, but clearly I can't be diagnosed based on a CT scan.  If the nodes are actually much larger than he estimated, will he be more inclined to biopsy?  I just don't know.

So, questions...  If the CT scan shows these nodes are the size he estimated, the largest being 2cm...  Should I be concerned?  I've read in some places anything over 1cm is concerning, but elsewhere lists normal up to 2cm.  I have also read that lymph nodes located near your collar bone are almost always alarming.  Yet my ENT does not seem concerned in the least bit.

If the largest one turns out to be bigger than 2cm and the ENT still doesn't want to procede, should I seek another opinion?  Another ENT, or an oncologist?  Would I be better off speaking to my GP about it?

I believe these nodes have grown over time, they haven't gotten any smaller for sure.  I wish I had tracked them better...  I definitely am obsessing over all of this, but at the same time I hate to delay treatment if it is indeed cancer.  I just have a really bad feeling about it.  Sorry my post is kind of a mess...

Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

I have had very low white blood cell counts since 2004. Finally, saw a hemotologis in 2007 who diagnose MDS with Refactory Anemia.  I was advised no known cause and  and no cure.  I have not had a bone marrow biopsy. I am receiving supportive care only. Some research I've done indicated that my low wbc could be due to diurects--which I take.Does anyone have any info about this as a possible cause.

I would like to hear from anyone who have the same DX , and who may be receving treatment.  Thanks so much.

My platelets were 487 and had gone down alittle from last time. I thought he said my white count was 17 but I wonder if I heard him wrong and its 70. I have had some bone pain and they thought I had a stress fracture and they did a bone scan that showed some arthritis. My hips ache at times too. But mostly now I get aches all over...mostly my arms and hands. I dont usually get sick and was very active..walking 2 or more miles at least 3 days a week. Since all this started I ahvent been walking. I really dont feel sick I am just so worried I think I am making myself feel worse. 
My armpits feel inflamed and I also feel my glands on my body, its weird but they dont hurt just feel inflamed. With high white counts the hematologist mentioned leukemia. He ran several tests before he said that but he said he didnt see any leukemia cells. He said we could go ahead and do a bone marrow biopsy or just wait a few more months. I am worried and when I talked to him about it he said I shouldnt worry about it.

I am just trying to get a handle on why the cbc for my son is not normal.  8 mos. ago he had a cbc because he was so tire all the time and just not feeling good.  He asked to go to doc.  The results were low WBC really pretty low.  I didn't get too alarmed.  2 mos later I took him to doc, she ran liver panel and another cbc along with mono test.  She said not to be concerned because the lymphocytes did'nt look bad. He didn't show mono, but the WBC still low and even alittle lower than before.  She said to repeat cbc in 6 months.   It has now been 6 mos.  He has an appt tomorrow but I got the blood test back today for the CBC.  Today WBC , RBC, Hgb, MCHC are all flagged low.  Oddly  there is a Eos% flagged high=>10.300(range 1.000-5.000),  I just want to make sure he gets the right testing if more testing is needed.  We live in a very small rural area.   He is 18 and seemingly healthly except for being really tired.  He has one sibling who has many allergies to foods(wheat) but he hasn't seemed to have these allergies.

Please help me if you can.

                I completed treatment for Hodgkin's disease in September and in my first follow up scan, I already showed cancerous nodes again (or still?).  Two weeks ago I went in for a biopsy to get 2 lymph nodes removed to diagnose me.  I had swelling under the incision spot that was hard to touch, and then the other day, i felt intense pain throughout my neck and the swelling grew A LOT. My surgeon refused to help me when I was in his office. He sent me to ER and I was told it was hematoma.  I spent the night in the hospital for observation, then released the next day. I was given no instructions, just told it would take care of itself.  I've since spent 3 days resting and my neck is still VERY sore. It is not any better then when I was released from the hospital.  

I can barely hold my head up. It's hard for me to imagine, this is normal and I am supposed to just deal with this.

What can I do to help get past this hematoma????

                I have had swollen, supraclavicular lymph nodes since 8/06. There are 2 or 3 of them in a cluster. The largest is a size of a pea.
Approximately one year ago, I had one of them removed. The pathology came back as beign, reactive.
There is now another large one that replaced the one they removed.
I feel o.k. I am really tired usually and do have night sweats on occassion.
Why are they still swollen and painful after all this time? I know that medicine is a science, not an exact. But, I'm getting sick of them.
The only possibility I can think of other than some lymphoma, is perhaps chronic EBV? Could the lymphs be clogged up with virus? 
Any suggestions, thoughts would be much apprecated.

Does anyone have similar symptoms:

recent gallbladder removal due to a year of problems
High platelets just recently (557,000)
Anyone have any suggestions?  Should I seek another opnion?  I also have severe night sweats where I feel drenched around my neck, ankles and chest.

                Hi Doctor. My daughter got diagnosed with Leukemia when she was 4 years old (November 2006). Well the first 6 months were the hardest (hair loss, fatigue, etc, etc). First year she was hospilitized 3 times because of fevers. Now she is doing great !!! Her ANC counts never go below 1,000. It did once in the past 3months, but its always generally 1,000-3,000. She is chubby and eats and plays. Her last month of treatment is actually next month (hoooray). She is doing so well that her doctor increased her 6mp Mercaptopurine pill. It use to be one a night 7 days a week. Now its one pill one night and the next night a pill and a half and so on. She takes Methotrexate once a week (6 pills at once). Since she is healthy they increased it to 7 pills one day a week. She is also on bactrim and Dexamethasone. The only side effect is that the dexamethasone makes her body itch, but we give her benadryl and it helps our greatly. Well all has been well, but 4 months ago she started having anal itch. I took her to the ""ER"" and they treated her for pinworms. It did not help. Well her doctor said it could be a tiny rupture because one of Bactrim side effect is that it makes you strain and it could cause rupture. Well the itch was still bad. I had to put her in hot water and give her benadryl. Well it works at times, but not all the time. Cortizone 10 kinda of helps. This is something that comes and goes and I am puzzled. One night she woke up and said her vagina itch. I am a single dad and it freaked me out. Well she pulled little clear strands out of her privates. It was clear like mucus with a little red (like blood). I put it in a piece of paper and it looked like someone blew their nose. Well I freaked and took her to the ""ER"". I showed the doctor and she didn't seem worried. She said it could be because of the Bactrim. She has been taking bactrim for 2 1/2 years why would it cause this now? she takes one pill 3 days a week. She is only 6 years old. Doctor at the ""ER"" said not to worry so I was at ease. Well it still comes out every now and then. sometimes  2-3 strands at a time. Her mom said this happend to her when she was 8. Well I told her regular hematologist doctor and she was like ""what"". She was surprised and inspected her and she said their no infection. Nothing visibily wrong with her vagianl area. Well nothing came out at the doctors office. Well when we got home my daughter said look daddy after she use the restroom and needless to say more came out. Her anal itch and this has me up at nights and I am scared something more seriously be wrong, but I am not getting any response from her doctors. Could this be medecine related? I called the Hemotologist on duty at the hospital and said its nothing to panick about because it could be medicine related, but different doctors tell me different things. One more question she bruises easily, but her counts are normally high, but what makes her bruise easily? thank you and God Bless

                My 11 yr has three enlarged lymph nodes... one behind his ear, back of his neck and one on the back of his head.  The surgeon just biopsied the one behind his ear and said it was dead, which I've now learned the correct terminology for is necrotic.  I understand necrotic lymph node means it was cut off from blood supply by either infection or disease.  However- I'm going crazy with worry for the next two weeks for the results.  My son has had no fever, no night sweats, no symptoms what so ever- not even  a little cold in over 4 months.  These appeared over 8 weeks ago and have only grown larger- not reduced.  

Is there any chance this is nothing?  Can some minor illness not presenting symptoms cause the lymph node to grow so rapidly and thus be cut off from blood flow?  I'm more terrified and blowing things up in my head because my mother died of lymphoma- Non Hodgkins.  Any encouraging news- or any news at all that could narrow it down good or bad?

                Hi everyone, i'm 15 years old and quiet a bit overweight. Lately i've been getting pain like everywhere, on my neck, chest, abdomen and back this pain is pretty strong but it is not constant. I done some research people said this might be swollen lymph nodes and etc. 

These days i found 4 of these little tiny red spots i believe its called petechiae, they are like the size of a pins point and it is bright red. It is located on my right arm starting from the back of my hand all the way to the elbow, it sort of makes a curve. Now i get frequent sore feeling on my whole right arm, also my left upper leg and i guess around pelvic as well as headache.

I do sweat a lot these days and been drinking heaps of water, but i believe this is caused by summer. However i never sweaten this much before. I did had some nosebleeds as well, but i do nosebleed a lot before until my doctor told me to use nasal spray and it helped me stop bleeding for around a month. The nosebleed are not hard to stop but it comes all in a sudden or when i poke my nose.

I have went to my family doctor a month ago before i had red spots and sore feeling. I went there because i had abdominal pain and loss of appetite. I had a blood test (don't know what kind of blood test is it) and an x-ray on abdomen, i was told that i am all fine but low on 'good' cholestrol due to lack of exercise.

I do not have too many symptoms of leukemia but are there a chance? Could a simple blood test from my family doctor detect anything?(took blood test before having red spots and other symptom)  Also my parents never had any cancer before.Or am i just too worried and need to calm down to stop thinking of these things?

user_597908,taxmeless,/posts/Leukemia-and-Lymphoma-/Help--Really-Scared-due-to-rising-elevated-white-count/show/756641,Help- Really Scared due to rising elevated white count,"
                Ok- so I went to my GP on 1/28 with two issues after returning from a business trip. Both turned out to be trouble. 
1) I had fallen down on ice- and my thumb was injured
2) I had a badly swollen lymph node in my neck.

He prescribed Augmentin and made an appointment for me with a hand specialist. I started  taking Augmentin on 1/29. Went to the hand specialist on 2/3/09. THe hand specialist confirmed I had torn my ligament and needed surgery asap since the injury can only be repaired if it is done expediantly. As customary I guess, a CBC is performed before surgery and was done on 2/4/09. The white count showed an elevated count of 13,000. Surgeon wont perform elective surgery with an elevated white count. So I take a follow-up, and the count is 17,000 the next day on 2/5. Now I am in limbo with my thumb and concerned about my health. My GP makes an appointment with a Hematologist the next day (2/6) and it shows 18,000. He draws about 6 viles of blood for what seems like a complete blood analysis that in large part wont have results returned until this Thursday. So I go online, and I read about white counts and fears of Leukemia or STDS emerge in my mind. I have no outtward signs of infection including the lymph node going down to normal and the hospital did some additional blood tests that showed no confirmed infections in my system. What's more, a chest xray ordered by my GP was negative (I am a smoker) Today I do feel kinda weak and like something is wrong.  So I am left worried I have something really serious and I cant fix my thumb until I confirm no infection or my white count declines. I am so scared right now!!! HELP!!!

anyways i went to the dr, and tey orded a bunch of tests. got a full bloodwork done up, a pft, and a heart monitor for a day. the dr called me back bout a week later to let me know my white count was high and so i went and had some more blood work. now i dont want to jumpt he gunm i went and looked up what high white count could mean and obviously a virus or somthing i must say i havent felt nessicarily sick.. just tired all the time. my appointment is on monday the 9th and i hate to sound like i am jumping the gun. but i am getting more and more worrie as i get closer to my appoint the office was very vauge when they called me. 

oh and a lil backround info . i am over weight, my cholestoral is a issue , i am currently a smoker (i have tried everything to quit i asked my dr for chantix) my mother has lupus ( i did research that first but dont seem to ahve alot in common with it)and diabetes runs in my family iam not sure about leukimia. and when i was very young i had a stay in the hospital . swollen joints, a butt rash and couldnt hold food or water down (somthing also bout juvenile arthritis nothing ever came of it )

                Hello, 

Today while taking a shower, I noticed a lump under my skin.  It is under my left clavicle, between my shoulder and sternum.  Looking at pictures of the lymphatic system, it looks like it could be a swollen lymph node.  Because of the location, it looks to me like it could be a swollen axillary lymph nodes (levels III?).
I did some research about cat scratch disease, Hodgkin's, etc... here are some of the symptoms I have had.


I have had migraines almost all of my life, and was put on prescription medicine about 3 years ago.

For the past year or so I have had felt ""uncomfortableness"" in my chest area.  i thought it was something that had to do with my hear but I wasn't too worried about it, but now that I have this swollen lymph node it made me think.

About a month ago I was sick and experienced an upset stomach and vomiting. It last 24 hours.

I rarely get sick, but I recently got over a cold (2 weeks ago).  I am still experiencing minor cold symptoms like a runny nose.

When I had the cold it was a bit difficult to breathe, but that has passed

A week ago I got scratched by my cat (which made me think of cat scratch disease)

I have experienced fatigue (but this has happened to me for as long as I can remember on and off throughout my life so it seems normal to me)


I'm 20, short and skinny, my aunt had hogdkins, my dad once had a swollen lymph node, and thats all of the related history I can think of right now.

I haven't had fever, night sweats, nausea, etc.
I am just wondering if anyone has an opinion of what this could be, or any type of information about this type of thing.
I am going to go see a doctor later this week.

Thanks.

                I have what I thought were enlarged lymph nodes on the right side of my neck. I have a grade 2 tectal glioma. My neuro-oncologist noticed them 9 mths ago and said they were lymph nodes. Over the past year my right arm and shoulder have been getting progressively weaker. I went for my follow up mri and saw the dr. afterward. He said my tumor appeared to be stable. It has not been biopsied due to its location. I asked him about the lymph nodes still being enlarged. I told him how weak my arm and shoulder have become. It is now affecting my every day life. He felt of my neck and said those aren't lymph nodes. He checked my arm and shoulder and could tell a marked weakness. I am right handed. He said since I already have the glioma we better get some scans. I am scheduled for a cspine mri and a brachial plexus mri. I do not know what he is thinking. It will be a long time until next week to get the results. The Dr. said he would call me. Looking for some input.

                I am 30 yr old and have had treatment for Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia that was diagnosed in June, 2008. Now I am on the maintainence therapy and my Blood Counts are normal and I am in Remission by grace of God. Currently, I had started feeling abdominal discomfort in my left lower side almost 10 days ago. Initially it looked to me as if it is a muscle streching at that part of abdomen because it used to feel as if it is just in the muscles just underneath the skin when I pressed by left lower abdomen just on left on my bladder. It also felt to me in the same area, when I streched my left leg forward. In mean time i was also having semi formed increased frequency of stool. 
But as the days passed, the pain in that lower left abdominal area has decreased a lot though i feel it yet a little, while i press it. But I still feel often need to pass stool (a feeling that you have when are having loose watery stools), though stools mostly come in normal or semi formed consistency. 
I had reported about this problem to my clinic and the junior hematologist at duty there had ordered abdominal ultra sound along with testicular ulatrasound. The sonographer doctor performed ultrasound three days ago but didn't notice any abnormality in my testi or my abdomen or kidneys. 
But most lately, i mean since after thar, I have started feeling lot of sharp pain in the same lower left abdominal area, but pain now occurs quite deeper than the earlier muscular region there in abdomen now. And most of the time, this sharp pain seems to travel to my left testicle. It occurs occasionaly with a frequency of 4 to 6 times in 24 hours and remaining for about 10-20seconds at each occurence. Pain is so sharp that I wake up due to that if it occurs during the night time. And generally apart from that, I feel a discomfort feeling in my left testicle and chord connecting to it. I also feel kind of little pain in perinuem and penile region off and on but remember that I had a history of Peri Anal fistuela that was operated in 2000. Though it had healed from outside after giving lots of post surgical troubles yet i had feeling for discomfort for it till to date owing to it. 
I get chemo shot for maintainance therapy after every 60 days. Last I had it on 12th Jan, 2009. Apart from that I am taking Purinethol tablets 150mg for ALL treatment that I have to stop now after 5 days of current usage owing to high ALT and nausea feeling. It happened in previous usages as well. My Nuetrophila, WBC, RBC and Platlets are normal by grace of God. 
Please tell me what could be the cause. Is it relapse in testis or related chord? May it not be so, but it is then is it possible that it might not have been detected during Abdominal + testical ultrasound that was done 3 days ago? Please reply me about this. And also tell me if ultrasound could have not been enough to detect it, then what other detection methods can be used? Or otherwise what other things can cause such situations? 
Regards! 
Sincerely, 
Waqas.

                This is not the first time this ever happened. This is the 3rd time in the last 6mos. My nodes are swelling along the left side of my neck. Last time I had a check up, even the Dr was surprised by how much I have on both sides of my neck. Everything was negative except that my WBCs were a little high. I had a fever then..I don't have a fever now! What in the world is this? The only thing I take different right now is an organic multivitamin w/c I am about to maybe stop anytime soon, if this gets worse. Not sure that, that might be the cause. Other than that, everything else is the same. I drink Green Tea everyday and it never bothers me. These nodes are getting bigger. And not juz a couple..ther are about 3-4 of em. I feel kinna nauseous right now, actually. That's all about it. I am concerned.

                I’m not sure I’m getting good advice from my healthcare provider.

I'm 44, male and in seemingly good health.  4 weeks ago I noticed a single painless swollen lymph node in the jugular region of my left neck.  I waited a week for it to subside and then went to the Doctor (did not see regular Doctor).  He checked my neck and asked several questions.  No mention of possible infection or starting an antibiotic.  His next step was to see a surgeon in 1-2 months.  I asked him what that meant and he said to check for Lymphoma.  Needless to say I was concerned.  I said, “So I have to stew about Cancer for 2 months?”  He didn’t really answer.  As I was leaving the appointment he literally chased me to the elevator and said he was going to order an ultrasound of the area before the surgical appointment.  

Fast forward two weeks and I have the ultrasound on my neck.  I get a call from the next day from the aforementioned Doctor and all he tells me is the lymph nodes are abnormal and I need to see the surgeon in 2-weeks.  I ask him how concerned I should be and he really has no answer.  I got frustrated and called the office back.  Several hours later my Primary Care Doctor called me back.  She says that she’s cancelling the surgical appointment and prescribes a general antibiotic and wants to follow up in two weeks. She says I’m relatively young, in good health and since the nodes in question are still fairly small this should be nothing to worry about. She says the next step would be a CT scan before the surgeon.  I also feel like the lymph node may be going down a bit.

Today I’m scratching an inch on my neck just above my collarbone and notice another lump.  This is on the right side (opposite side from the neck gland).  Its pea-size moves around and feels firm.  I can only really feel it if I lift my right arm above my shoulders.  There is nothing similar on the left side.  My research tells me you can’t feel “normal” lymph nodes. 

Needless to say since the scare 2-weeks ago I’ve done a fair amount of online research (both a blessing and curse).  Should I call my Doctor with this new development or just take the antibiotics and call her in a couple of weeks?  Could these two nodes be related even though they are not near each other?    Back in September I did get a case of ringworm under that arm that cleared right up with a prescribed fungicide.  Would that leave some residual swelling in that area?

I’ve read about Lymphoma symptoms.  I do feel fatigued more than usual lately and I get chills (no apparent fever) from time to time but I’d be the first to admit that I’m stressed and its winter in New England.   

Is the best thing to just watch and wait or should I push this? I hear a lot about blood tests.  Would that be warranted here yet?

Thanks.

                okay a little detail here ... but i am in limbo status at the moment until my next doctor appointment feb 3rd

Hx: 
43 yo fem G4 P3 Ab ! married 23 yrs same guy hx of sporadic infertility
 hysterectomy 7/31/08 (TAH/BSO) 1C serous borderline Cancer of the Ovaries 
Numerous complications in post OP including 60 - 80 O2 sat for 7 days (spent in ICU)
diffusre air space disease secondary to aspiration pneumonitis .. i wasnt clotting well
during the operation either termed as ""oozy""
liver an sesum were ""socked in"" (visual observation) due to presumed prior inflammatory process (that i never knew i had)
watchful waiting for follow up no chemo indicated CA-125 repeated every 3 months, scan as indicated

My gyn onc at a cancer treatment center ordered a blind path after my final diagnosis 
In passing he ""mentioned"" a possible small b cell lymphoma (i had never heard of a b cell before) and to return again in 3 months ... i was happy as a clam  and drove (almost three hours home) and started to wonder ... ""what the heck is a b cell and why is he looking at it"" so i looked it up .. in this case knowledge can be frightening but it spurs us into action ..

I need to ask my primary care provider to follow up on this (appt is feb 3rd)
any ideas what to ask for ?
my guesses are cbc, full chem panel with creatinine, prothrombin test, and as we all would like, a full pet/ct scan that they are hestitant to do at theis point 

i have had tsh test (normal) 
nurmerous chest ct's (non contrast)
two normal echo cardiograms
my last bld chemistry was not a full chem so i dont knwo what to think of that 
hepatitis was negative

current symptoms (some could be hormonal related)
I AM LOOSING MY HAIR post op and i didnt have chemo (i wake up and find it on the pillow)
pain in RUQ (possibly in the liver) for many years
i lost 1 mm thickness im ALL of my fingernails
drenching night sweats and hot flashes 
dark (but not alarmingly dark) urine best to describe it as much darker than normal but not weird

so .. anyone in the know of what to intelligently ask my pcp on the third ??
any other things i can thro in there that would be helpful
i would appreciate all opinions from surviivor/caregiver/professional
and take them all to heart 

i pray u are well

                Last year I asked my GP about enlarged lymph nodes at the front base of my neck, about 6 in all.  They are evident when I tense my neck muscles slightly.  She dismissed them and said that sometimes the nodes become prominent when you put on weight, which I had done. I still have the enlarged nodes and am now experiencing fatigue, breathlessness and itchy skin, particularly on my legs.  A few weeks ago my ankles were so itchy it was almost unbearable, and there was no reason for it such as bites or a rash.  I am therefore concerned about having lymphoma.  I have an appointment anyway to see another GP about another matter in 4 weeks (I cannot get in to see her any sooner) and intend to ask her for a second opinion. I am wondering, should I see my normal GP instead if it means a sooner appointment?  I cannot go to another surgery in town without transferring my entire medical records to them, which I don't want to do at this stage. Thank you for your advice.

                I discovered two painless, swollen lymph nodes (larger than a pea) on the back left side of my neck, right below the hairline.  A couple of days later, I found two more - this time on the front right side of my neck, down by the collarbone.  One is marble-sized.  The doctor found no other enlargements elsewhere on my body.

In addition, I have a rash consisting of some very small red bumps on my left upper back/neck, shoulder, and chest.  It is somewhat itchy and has a burning feeling.  Clothing and the seat belt irritate it.

My doctor tried an antibiotic first; it has been almost a week, and there is no change.  Blood tests (white cell count was one of them) turned up normal.  I am awaiting the results of a chest x-ray.

I have had periodic drenching night sweats for years, usually right before my period, when I have the heat on and am using the down comforter, or when accompanied by vivid dreams.  I have also had periodic deep-under-the-skin itching on the bottom of my foot for years.

I am 38 and female.  My paternal grandmother died of lymphoma at age 68.  Naturally, I am concerned.

Do my symptoms seem indicative of cancer, since infections appear to be ruled out?  My doctor thinks the glands enlarged too quickly for it to be cancer, and he didn't recommend any biopsies.  I see him again on Friday.  What seems to be the best course of action?

                I have been suffering from lymph node pain for almost 2 months now. It started on the right side of my neck and quickly spread to other lymph nodes in the neck and then groin. I do not feel anything in the armpits. Currently I have persistent pain/discomfort in the lymph nodes in the neck and groin area. Sometimes the pain is like a pinch and goes away in 1-2 seconds (more in the groin area), but mostly I would have a dull ache in one area in the neck ALL day long. The pain is not severe but it creates discomfort and drives me crazy. I think this may be something serious. Never heard about lymph node pain this long. I think nodes are not swollen. The neck ultrasound a month ago was normal. I feel normal and do not have any other complaints. Just maybe the back of my right knee is itchy sometimes. I do not know if there is a connection though.

I saw an MD (oncologist) for this problem and he requested some test such as CBC,  liever enzym test: ALT, AST, ALP, LDH, and ESR and blood smear. He says he did not see any symptoms of Lymphoma. My ALT level came out high and he thinks I have had a sort of viral infection. But I still do have lymph node discomfort.

Blood Work (everything within normal ranges):

WBC: 7.3
RBC: 4.78
Neutrophils %63
Lymphs %24
Monocyes %7
Eos %6
Basos %0
Platelets 372
Hemoglobin 15.4
MCV 95
MCH 32
Hematocrit 45.3

Liver Enzymes

ALT 98 (high, normal 10-40)!!!
AST 31 (normal 15-40)
ALP 63 (normal 40-129)
LDH 208 (normal <225)
----------------------------------

ESR 9 (normal <15)

Did anyone experience something like this? Any systematic/generalized discomfort in the lymph nodes for a long time with no obvious swelling? The nodes I can feel (two on the sides of the neck below ear) are moveable and dont seem to hurt to the touch.

                I was told by 3 radioligist that the mulible spleenic noduals in my speen was lymphona, but when I went in for the biopsy they didn't get anything and said the spleen is hard to biopsy because it is so vasular. I have been juicing and cleansing and eating a vegitarian raw foods diet and have seen improvement in my symtoms but still have pain in my spleenand  my MRI was unchanged after 3 months. The oncologist wants to repeat the MRI next month and keep an eye on it. My question is, is there any one out there that can successfully biopsy the spleen without removing the spleen? Without a biopsy they can't tell me the type or stage.

                Hello all! I'm the new Community Leader, and am in the process of creating more Health Pages for our community! 

A few ideas I have are: 
""Understanding Leukemia"" - This will include the different sub-types
""Understanding Lymphoma"" - and will include info on Hodgkins and Non-Hodgkins

I'm considering including in each the different ways used to diagnose these conditions since they are different, as well as different treatment options available for each.

If any of you have comments, ideas or suggestions on content for these or other issues pertaining to the community, I'd be happy to hear them.

I look forward to getting to know you all and making this a helpful, caring and supportive community!

                Hi everybody

Sorry to be long ... but I wanted to be as thorough as I could.

I have my follow up appointment for lymph node inflammation coming up on Friday and want to be prepared enough to know what I might be dealing with.  I'm 22 years old, and I made the initial appointment regarding several lymph nodes in my kneck that I feel have been swollen for months, namely the large one underneath my left jaw, which is the only one swollen larger than 1 cm., or so it seems.  I haven't had any recent night sweats, fevers or chills, but I did last June when I feel like all this could have started.  I had what I thought was mono and was living in a different city, and couldn't get a doctors appt. anywhere.  I thought it was fine, because the fever, chills and sore throats all eventually went away.  The lymph nodes haven't, but they haven't changed in size at all since they've swollen initially.

I made the first appointment to have the nodes checked out, and my doctor gave me an antibiotic and advised me to not touch them for two weeks and then make a follow up appointment.  The antibiotic hasn't appeared to do anything, and the largest lymph node I can still see under my kneck.  It's freely movable and the skin over it doesn't appear to be red or irritated.  It is firm and is not tender.  There are other nodes on both sides of my neck that I can feel are small but firm, and there's at least one that's swollen that I can see in the abcess below my trachea when I flex my neck.  I've tested negative twice for HIV and other STDs, have not had many partners and do not use drugs.

The baffling part is that I have a number of vague symptoms that no one's been able to diagnose.  I get these little, pulsing pains all over my body that I've thought were lymph nodes because I feel them in those areas (neck, thighs, groin, elbows, knees), but I really feel them all over my body, and get them every day.  I also have been experiencing muscle twitches for several months, too.  My eyelids are slightly swollen, and my eyes are always red and soggy gray, and I can hear my stomach rumbling after I eat, especially in my lower abdomen, though there is really no pain that accompanies it.

Phew.  Sorry, but that's it, and I want to know how I can ask for these symptoms to be diagnosed so I can put my mind at ease for the first time in a long time.  Thank you so much for reading.

                about 3 weeks ago i noticed the nodes behind my sons ear ( mastoid region) were swollen. They didn't hurt nor were they warm to the touch or tender. he has no symptoms whats so ever but i took him to the Dr anyway.

During the exam we found out its almost every node in his body ( armpits, neck, groin ...) So the Dr ordered blood work a CBC with diff, CMP, and a Mono spot. All came back 100% normal.

There is no sign of infection not viral or bacterial and my son has absolutely no symptoms other than these enlarged nodes.

Dr has since referred us to a hematologist. We,re just waiting for a call with a date and time but i am very concerned.

Is it possible to have lymphoma or leukemia with his blood work completely normal?  

What can be causing all these nodes to be swollen?  I am very scared an anxious and confused.

                My daughter started having swollen lympnodes in her neck & groin area with out any signs of being sick at age 19 months. Then she started running low grade fevers for about 5 months and had a weight loss. During thoses months we also noticed her tonsils became enlarged which started causing her to have sleep apnea. At 2 yearls Old Her regular doctor recommended her going to ENT because he was thinking that the tonsils were causing the swelling in lympnodes. The ENT reccomended removal of tonsils & adnoids ASAP because of sleep apnea. She went for surgery on Dec. 29th 2008. ENT ran test on tonsils for lymphoma because she was very concerned with the swollen lympnodes & fevers (Test came back normal) & couldn't give me a reason for her tonsils being swollen. We went for her 3 week check up after surgery & ENT says that she is healing great in throat but is still concerned with the enlarged lympnodes. She goes back to ENT in 6 weeks to see if there is some change in size of lympnodes. ENT said that if Lympnodes are still swollen at her re-check she will then reccomend us going back to regular doctor for him to do more testing to find out the cause of swollen lympnodes in neck & groin. Should I be concerned? Is it possible she does have lymphoma ? Are there any other test that I should have done when she goes back to her regular doctor? I am trying not to worry but I thought that she would be better after surgery.

                Hello - my husband has a rather large (4 cm) mass on the right side of his neck, above the collar bone. We're awaiting the results of an FNA biopsy earlier this week. We're not sure what it is, but the CT scan and the ultrasound indicated that it was a very fluid mass. In fact, the biopsy removed a lot of straw-colored liquid and the mass nearly completely disappeared after the procedure. The next morning, however, the mass had returned to its original size.

My questions, while we wait for the results (which is very hard to do): Would a mass this fluid likely be benign? And is it unusual for it to refill so quickly after biopsy? 

Thank you for your help! We are very concerned.

                I hope someone on this forum can address my question.  

A little personal data to provide context:  I am a 37 year old white male, 160 lbs, 6 feet tall.

Over the last year or two, I have noticed an increase in the frequency with which I become tired, fatigued, and ill.  My hands are often cold and my eyes are red and irritated.  Over the last few months, I've noticed that my skin seems to bruise much more easily than before (ie, even after routine bumps in the gym, sitting on a hard chair, etc).  Over the last week, I came down with a fever (102 for two days) and bad headache followed by stuffy nose, cough, a slight rash on my chest and other flu-like symptoms. Such flu-like episodes have become more frequent for me of late.  Over the last 2-3 weeks prior to the most recent fever, I noticed that my average body temperature was slightly higher than normal (98.6 vs a normal body temp of about 97.8).  Even since I was a child, I have had subcutaneous pin-size red dots on my palms and upper thighs that come and go; I never gave much thought to these, but after doing a little research on blood disorders, I'm wondering if they might be a sign of subcutaneous bleeding associated with leukemia or some other disease.  

My last blood test in June 2008 revealed normal levels of RBCs, platelets and WBCs (latter were a little low, but still within the normal range).  Likewise, CD4 levels were lowish but within normal range.  A year and a half ago, I had a blood smear which showed all RBCs and WBCs to be normally shaped and sized.  About the same time, I was tested for alphafetoprotein and CEA, both of which were normal. 

My questions:  Do any of my symptoms seem indicative of a blood cancer or suggest I should have some follow up tests?  Would it be possible to develop a cancer within the space of a year and a half or less (when my last tests showed normal results)?  If not cancer or some autoimmune problem, does anyone have an inkling of why I might suddenly be bruising so easily?

Thanks for your feedback.

Attwell

                I am 19 years old, and a male. Okay, so i have a few swollen lymph nodes on the left side of my body. They are located on the back of my neck, and my groin. They have been swollen between 1-2 months. Went to ER twice. The first time they did a cat scan of my head, chest x-rays, and an assortment of blood tests, spleen, liver, not really sure what all was done. Took 6 tubes of blood. All came back okay, said my white-cell count was a little high, prescribed me to doxycycline (some kind of antibiotics). Cat-scan was fine nothing abnormal aside from a little fluid/gas buildup in my pharynx. Went back around 7 days later complaining of same symptoms. The only symptom I even had were excessive fatigue and the enlarged lymph nodes. The neck lymph nodes were the only swollen ones at the time (or i hadn't at least noticed the groin ones). They then proceeded with the same methods, cat-scan, chest x-ray, EKG on heart this time, same amount of blood tests. This time my white-cell count was normal. Chest x-ray showed I had some mild bronchitis, but I hadn't been coughing or anything really. Returned next morning for an echocardiograhm in which the results were sent to a larger hospital. Results came back okay after a couple days. Now it's been about 4 weeks. The lymph nodes on neck are still swollen, haven't gotten any larger though. Now I've notice my lymph nodes in groin are swollen as well. Still have some fatigue but not as bad as before. What can any of you folk make of this? How long should they remain swollen? I wasn't told I had mono or anything but hell with doctors nowdays I don't even know if they really checked. Any help or insite is appreciated.
Thanks

                I have had this mass for about 2 years.It was tiny and a month ago I noticed a small mass on the side of my neck and then proceeded to check the other 1 and to my surprise it was alot bigger.. I had a mammogram,ultrasound,and CT w and w/out contrast...The Ct came back suspicious so they called me in to do a biopsy with ultrasound..It is an enlarged lymph node 1.23cm.The radiologist came in and we looked at the ultrasound pic taken and it looked like a cyst. He said it was until he started to biopsy and he couldn't get any fluid out of it Then he changed his tone well I could be wrong he says........... He uses 9 needles 2 18's / 2 16's and 5 10's...........He only could get some blood that was not pus like a cyst...........The Raidologist came in and was doing something with the nsamples and then came to me asking me questions about do i sweat at night and how have i been feeling...........Can anyone speculate on anything that could help?

                Hi, I'm a 26 year old female. I've been sick and feeling progressively worse since I had a miscarriage in November. I have low hemoglobin (but I'm slowly able to build it back up.) Anyway, the sickness that I've been experiencing includes, dizziness, shortness of breath (which is getting worse), fatigue, nausea, dry mouth, swollen gums, muscle weakness, and petechia, I've been suffering in silence until the beginning of this month. I finally ended up in the ER because my dizziness was so bad that I fainted. I had a CBC done and found that my RBC, HGB and HCT were very low. Everything else tested normal. Well, I ended up back in the ER yesterday because I could hardly catch my breath all day, my breathing was shallow, my muscles in my arms were so weak that they felt numb, and I had a pain/tenderness in my left upper abdomen directly under my rib cage. I had another CBC and urinalysis done and my abnormal results were as follows:

Lymphocyte, Absolute:3.12 (H)
Prothrombin Time:16.4 (H)
My WBC was normal but I thought it was odd that the count was 5.75 3 wks ago and yesterday it was 9.17

The abnormal results on my urinalysis were as follows:

RBC urine: 4 (H)
WBC urine: 12 (H)
Nitrates were negative.

Anyway, the ER doctor didn't really tell me much, but I'm supposed to follow up with an internist in 3 days. Before I do that though, I was just wondering what might be wrong with me, what I might be facing and things like that. Does it seem like there might be a problem or maybe it's nothing? My aunt died 3 years ago from leukemia. I don't want to end up that way.

Hello everybody,

firstly can i say that loads of people on this web site seem to be suffering from very similar symptoms, well I am another one, it began well over 3 months ago now, just after i had unprotected oral sex with another man, very stupid of me at the time. stright after preforming this i began to panic and thinking of the worst things like HIV, i began to get symptoms very similar to HIV, sore throat, itchy rashes, head aches etc, i di get tested for all std's from a clinic in town and the results came back negative.

this is good but am still haveing these problems! my groin area is swollen at the very top of my legs on both my legs is a swollen area which is not a lump but feels soft and to look at looks like extra fatty tissue, it doesnt hurt at all, but more recently i have had pain in the tops of my legs in my hip area and i have felt little meaty lumps running from the tops of my legs to my groin, also i have felt a little jelly lump in my neck and i offen have neck aches.
my armpits are the other area were i have the same ache, i have tried to feel for lumps in my armpits but i cannot feel any lumps it just aches so much.
i have had spots and rashes appear all over my body but the worst pat is the inside of my legs were spots come up and itch like crazy!

am just hoping that someone can help me? i have been to the doctors endless amount of times over the last 3 months and nothing yet, i have been tested for leukemia and this came back negative, am just worring so much now becouse it seems to be getting worse, and have had pain at the bottom of my back below my cox sic,

does anybody have any ideas, i am open to any suggestions? or if anybody is going through the same thing?

                Well-here is my question-   I've been really sick for over a year-profound weight loss - 40 lbs. (5'4"" 105 pds)  I have had chronic Fever FUO since July- Since December it is over 100 every day.  I have enlarged cervical and bilateral axillary nodes (under arms) Fighting for a biopsy b/c they are barely over 1 cm. and a recent gallium scan was reported as normal, though that is under debate, b/c there is clearly mild uptake in under arm region at 72 hour scan. Night sweats, bone pain, lower back pain. 

CBC is generally normal.  Anemia one month, not the next, low immunoprotiens- electrophoresis test showed inconsistent:  Low IGM protein concentration, normal IGG-IGA-Normal serum levels for all three

EBV AB VCA IGG test came back at 2000, normal ref: 0-99

In 2004 I did have M spike and IGG positive test with very low WBC, RBC, and platelets though it normalized on it's own.

I see a clear possible lymphoma connection here.  Does anyone else concur?

                About 8 years ago I noticed a lump around the groin area, and the surgeon drained it for a few weeks until it was only a solid mass left. When he went into surgery he ended up taking out about 6 of them the biggest was the size of a baseball, and the smallest was the size of a walnut, the tests results were benign. 
Then today, I felt a lump/bumb around my hip area. Is this probably going to be the same thing? I really don't want to go through the surgery to have them removed again, because the first time there were complications, and I have ended up having lymphedema in the leg, with pain.
---- Should I have it looked at? Or should I go to a specialist this time, and if so, who would I go see?

                Hi!

I had my blood work done yesterday because I was concerned about bruising easily.  My doc's office called and said everything looked great!  My concern is that as many times in the past 3 years that I've had blood work done, my white cells have been anywhere from the 5,000's to yesterday, which was in the low 8,000s.  While I realize that these WBC's have always been in the ""normal"" range, I don't understand what makes them in the ""middle"" of the normal range one time or another, and then yesterday, in the ""higher"" part of the normal range.

Thanks!

                Hello,

I'm wondering if someone could give me some reassurance/advice. I have been struggling with health anxiety for some time. It all started back about 4 years when my dad was diagnosed with a severe heart condition (cardiomyopathy). They told him he had 5 years left, and I didn't deal so well with it. I went into a depression and suffered from panic attacks and health anxiety, etc. I convinced myself I had the same thing as my Dad and would drop dead from a heart arryhthmia. I eventually saw a therapist for this and got better. Then, in 2005, my mom was diagnosed with stage 3 breast cancer and it started all over again. I got very depressed about it, thinking I was going to lose her and that I also had breast cancer. Again, I saw a therapist and got better.

In July, my mom was diagnosed again with cancer, and it was found to have spread to her liver, lungs and bones. She passed away at the age of 47 in October. My mom was my best friend and it has been devastating to lose her, but I thought I was dealing rather well with it. However, a few months ago, I started having a hard time sleeping. I haven't slept well in porbably 2 months. Then, just before Christmas I started having a really upset stomach. Bad upper abdominal pain and I actually threw up once. I had bad problems with constipation too. And I have also lost 5 lbs in the last month, I just haven't felt like eating.  I went to the Dr and they sent me for bloodwork to check for my gallbladder and pancreas and also a CBC. just before that, I also started sweating at night, though not every night and it seemed like it was the same time every night too (just after I fell asleep). I started getting very afraid again that I had cancer, this time lymphoma. I started searching the internet high and low for every symptom I had. I knew I shouldn't be doing it, but I still did, and I couldn't stop. Over the last week, the sweating at night seems to have gone away and my stomach is better but on Monday, I noticed my groin hurt and I felt it and there was a small lump about the size of a pea. Of course this completely freaked me out. I am scared to death that I actually do have lymphoma. I was too scared to get the bloodwork done and I just got it done yesterday so don't have the results yet. Today, the lump seems a bit smaller, but the pain is gone (which I thought was a bad sign with swollen lymph nodes). The only thing I can think of is that I had an ingrown hair type thing in that area that got infected I think, so maybe that's why they are swollen in that area? 

Anyways, I am noticing a pattern, the same as the last time I convinced myself I had breast cancer. I start thinking about it constantly, search my symptoms, get terrified, thinking I am going to die. But I also notice that I'm missing my mom terribly, and overwhelmed with everything and taking care of my dad, our family business, etc and I just feel sad in general and I'm wondering if all of these symptoms are likely depression or something more that I should be concerned about. I don't even know if the lymph node is swollen, I mean I have never felt there before and I can only feel it if I press fairly hard, though it was painful before and is a little bit bigger than the other side though not much. 

I am sorry if this all sounds crazy, I wish I could get a hold of myself. Waiting for the tests results is torture. If they come back OK, is that enough to say I'm fine? When I was at the Dr. I didn't have the swollen lymph node, so I didn't show her, I wonder if I should go back? Do you think this is all in my head or could it be something more serious. 

Anyways, thanks for listening, I would appreciate any advice. 

Sincerely,
Erin

                My doctor is concerned that I may have lymphoma, I have two swollen lymph nodes on my collar bone about the size of a marble, about 2 centimeters in diameter, and two golf ball sized lymph nodes in my neck below my ear, all are on the right side.  However, I had an x-ray and blood work and the tests have come back normal.  The only other abnormailties I've been having are weakness, tiredness, shortness of breath, and high blood pressure.  (My blood pressure normally runs low).

Something that started recently is that I've been having ridiculous acid reflux for no apparent reason.

I'm going for a CT scan of my neck today, but what I'm curious about is should my doctor have recommended a CT scan of the rest of my body, or was the x-ray conclusive enough to rule out any other swollen lymph nodes in my chest and abdomen, or will that need to be done based on the results of my neck CT scan?

The blood tests have shown MCV hovering around 100 for last year or more, WBC are up to 4100 for a year, not anemic, borderline low red cells for at least 8 years. Lymphocytes never go up or down but nearly low, neutrophils dipped to low also. 
Otherwise normal blood.

                About 9 months ago I had a sore and swollen lymph node under my right underarm. I ended up having an ultrasound done after seeing my GP which returned a clear result. My GP thought it may be a reactive lymph node. 
Then just 3 weeks ago I had a node become enlarged but not sore behind my left ear. It only lasted a day or so and was the size of a marble. A few days later I noticed a soreness and ache under my right arm about an inch away from the previously reactive node. This ache is like a muscle ache but feels like it is on the outside of the ribcage wall(?). I cannot attribute this ache to any unusual exercise or activity. I saw my GP and she did a breast examination(with no concerns) and prescribed antibiotics. I completed 2 courses of these about a week ago. In the last week I have had relief from the ache under my arm and have had no swollen lymph nodes until today. Today I have a very sore lymph node deep under the left (other) arm, and a visible lump with no soreness high under my right arm almost where the biceps enter the axilla. (My neighbor noticed that one when I raised my arms). I will go and see my GP again, however am concerned at the length of time I seem to be getting these swollen nodes. I am concerned the ache under my arm that comes and goes is related somehow, and of course being a mother of 3 I am worried about breast cancer.

I thank you for any advice you can offer.

                I'm fourteen, and just recently, I noticed a hardish lump underneath my chin (mostly in the middle, but slightly to the right); it's about pea-sized (maybe smaller). I'm very worried that it may be cancer, because I have heard so much of the disease. I have also been very stressed out lately, if that may have anything to do with it... Could it only be swollen lymph nodes or something? I'm freaking out at the moment!!! Thanks in advance!

                As the title suggests, I have an enlarged axillary lymph node. My doctor rushed an ultrasound and blood work. 
The results were that it is a solid mass roughly 4cm in diameter. I don't know if this means anything, but the blood flow on the doppler was intense to this 'ball'. It did have clearly defined borders (which is a good thing, they said).

Due to fatigue, constant infections, etc. the doc ran a lupus test, which came back negative. Also, I had a 'left shift' (indicates neutrophils) with no infection at the time (just off antibiotics). 

My doc wants a biopsy Monday, so all this has been rushed. I didn't even realize why she seemed so panicked about the lump.

It is painless, no swelling around it, just a giant ball in the upper part of my armpit.

Does this sound like lymphoma is possible? Probable? I am having my biopsy, but I want to be prepared for the possibility...

Also, how long does it take to get biopsy results back?

                Hi.
My (32 years old) wife has swallon lymph nodes on both sides of her neck (one on each side).
She also had two swallon lymph nodes on back of her neck.   No swallon lymph nodes
in the arm pit or groin.  Should we be concerned the swalloness is in one area.
It started about four weeks ago with neck pain.  
We originally tried to get an appointment with ENT,
but no ENT wanted to see her since its not related to Ears, Nose, Throat.
We saw our family doctor and did some blood test.

WBC = 6.5
RBD = 4.35
Hemoglobin = 13.3


He said all the blood test is normal.  Ruling out Leukemia or last stage cancer.
He did not rule out lymphoma.   We are going to see an ENT he recommends
and then the ENT will do a full biospy of one of the lymph node and have it
reviewed by a pathologist.

My question is what is the possibility that this condition is an infection, inflammation,
or non-cancerous condition.   I hope its not lymphoma of any kind.
The major symptoms she has been having is fatigue,  NO loss of appetite, NO weigh loss,
NO fever, NO constaint headaches, NO dry coughing, NO itching,  NO trouble breathing, NO chest pain, NO soaking night sweets.   One evening she had some sweeting when she read some
of the symptoms of lymphoma.  

The biggest concern is that she gets tried easily and has weakness.
The swallon lymph nodes are not reducing.  They don't seem to be
getting larger either, but we are not experts to say that conclusively.  
But its has only been four weeks and nothing has changed.  


She has no family history of natural cancer (no tabacco or alcohol usage), 
She does not use tobacco, do not drink alcohol at all, and is vegetarian.

Is there anything that would indicate this condition in not related to lymphoma.
I hope its not the case.

Thank you.

I have had painless swollen glands for about a year. Recently I have red spots which are appearing on my face. They are a bit like acne but do not responde to acne treatment but get better with anticeptic cream. I have had lots of blood tests, all have come back within normal ranges apart from Hemoglobin which is over 19. My hemoglobin is always above the normal range for all the blood tests I have had over the last 6 months. I do smoke but not excessively which can be a possible cause. I have started to itch all over especially in my head. I have checked for nits and its not that! Last night I had a couple of glasses of wine and a beer. At 5am I was awoken by my heart racing and my glands were especially painful under my arms and above my elbows. Is the pain associated with alcohol and lymphoma an instant pain or can it be delayed??
Recently my whole body hurts, I went to accident and emergency due to chest pain and shortness of breath which I still have. They did a chest xray and another load of blood tests, all came back normal. The emergency doctor was concerned about my glands and sent for a B2 microglobulin test which takes a few weeks to do and I have not had the result yet. I think this is a tumor marker. I have pain up and down my spine which will not go away. I had a FNA of a gland a few weeks ago which has come back inconclusive. I see the ENT next week. 
Thanks for taking the time to read this, any thoughts would be most appreciated. Thanks.

                I, on and off, have pain on the right side of my neck. The submandibular lymph node there is painful and movable. It isn't really swollen, but it is bigger than normal. Maybe 1-1.5cm in size. The pain in my neck is actually quite an annoyance. Sometimes my right eye feels swollen or dry. I have had an ultrasound, the results haven't come back. My blood test was normal. The right side of my jaw occasionally hurts and the right side of my neck seems really tense.

I am definitely a hypochondriac, and this is driving me crazy. My doctor knows I'm a hypochondriac and so it seems like he doesn't take me as serious which is even more stressful. I'm tired a lot, and feel a bump on the cartilage just above my adam's apple on the right side, which makes me wonder if this swollen lymph node (which has been like this for a few months) is caused by an infection in my jaw or teeth/gums, or if its from something.

Basically, I'm asking if anyone has any ideas what this may be, and if anyone has any suggestions for me on how to talk to my doctor so they are aware how much this is worrying me and to test a bunch of different things. I come across things like lymphoma, sarcoidosis, mono and stuff, and just want to rule it out so I can get back to living my life without worry.

Thanks.

My family has an extensive history of lukemia, myeloma and lymphoma on fathers side and lukemia on mothers side.  
   
   What I did find odd was when my Physician (hemat) left and was replaced the new Hematologist who was shocked that I did not have a Bone marrow or biopsy done nor an MRI....The Physician said that they could not rule out myeloid (is that related to myeloma, my paternal aunt had that) or that they could not rule out malignancies with the thymus tissue.  But then, that was the last that I heard from her.  No follow-up, no nothing, even after several phone messages (this is a gov. facil.).  I attempted to get a second opinion but the records that the doctor received indicated that I was released.   All I have is the CT (which is dated 4 days prior to my last appt. with the hemo indicating splenogmegoly and lymph nodes remain unchanged), and my own notes to go by.   Any suggestions on where I should go from here?
I don't know what kind of Doctor to see to get a second opinion? what are the possibilities of what this could be?

Could this be like ebv or wegeners or allergies or what.

Thanks in advance.

                Earlier this year I had thyrod papillary carcinoma which was treated by a total thyroidectomy, followed by RAI.  

Two months post RAI, my WBC is 2.6, RBC 3.51, Hemoglobin 11.1, hematocrit 31.5, RDW 15.1, and absolute neutrophils 900.  Aside from checking iron and B12, any suggestions?

Can radioactive iodine decrease bone marrow output?

Thanks for any help.

                My daughter is 6years old and what appears to be a swallowen  lymphnoid at the base of her skull .
She at times has severe headaches and constant pain. When she was born she had a lump in the center of her skull that oozed . The doctors at that time thought it was an ingrown hair.So she was taking lots of antibiotic its never seemed to go away. Then she stopped taking them all together. It swelled the size of a baseball and burst. We were referaled to a dermatologist and he had started to cut in to remove it he noticed there was much more to this. So he stopped the removal and we were sent to a nuerosurgeon . When she was approximately 4 yrs old she had the surgery to have a dermoid tumor/cyst removed.It had grown a tail and looped in around the skull. Leaving a small hole in her skull. The doctor at that time at put in a fake piece of bone. A week or so later her body rejected that piece , which she had to have emergency surgery to have it removed. The infection was so severe she had to have a pic line. After a weeks stay in the hospital , there was no signs of the infection. And so they decied to remove the pic line instead of keeping the antibiotics going. There was always another part of her head that concerned the doctor he only could see a shadow in the scans. It looked as if someone had stuck a needle in her head , which never happened but there seemed to be a small hole .He told us to keep an eye on it make sure nothing came of it. Now theres  this knot , which we were told today is a lymphnoid. Is there any suggestions while we wait to be seen by a nuerosurgeon?

                My nan died in March, she had Milo Fibrosis which (from what i know) is a rare form of Leukemia. She had very low blood pressure and Iron Deficiency anemia and (probably unrelated) Diabetes.

I've just been told that i have Iron Deficiency Anemia and also have a very low blood pressure (82/55). Due to the similarities, im just wondering if Milo Fibrosis is related to Anemia or low blood pressure and if it is hereditary.

I know my mum doesnt want me to know alot about my nans illness because of the similarities and probably doesnt want to worry me but contrary to her intentions, i am worried. 

Help would be much appreciated x

                About two months ago, while in the shower I noticed that one inguinal node was significantly swollen(about the size of a marble). Same day I found a small, half dollar sized, blistery rash on sacral area(just above the middle of my butt). Docs assumes STD, which was highly unlikely since I am married and do not have a risky past. But we did all the tests anyway and all results were negative. Doc put me on an antibiotic and gave me an ointment for the rash. Within about a week rash was gone and node had receeded.
However, since then the nodes in my neck have swelled. My submandibular nodes are palpable and visible bilatteraly and I recentlty noticed some obvious swelling in the are of right paroitd gland. Also, although the original inguinal node is gone, I can now feel smaller(much smaller) nodes in groin area. I admit that I can only feel the groin nodes when i am trying to. Where as the original inguinal and current neck nodes are obvious.
I have had two normal CBC'S. A ""slightly elevated"" CPK(only 185). Other than some aches and fatigue no other symptoms. Last week I had a CT scan and i am very confused by results. Findings describe submandibular nodes as ""mildly prominent but not abnormal"" and parotid s ""normal"". If so, then why can i see them everytime i look in the mirror and feel them everytime I turn or lift my head?
Brief history. I am a 29 year old male. Healthy(personal trainer). My bad habbits are that I chew tobacco and drink 1-2 galsses of wine every night. No drugs, smoking, red meat, etc. Only family history is colorectal cancer and i have had two clean colonoscopys(2nd one last year). Also heart disease but I am checked regularly.
I should add that before this all began i had been dealing with a broken wisdom tooth that became pretty badly infected and i was off and on penecilin and norco for a couple months. I still have not dealt with the tooth(time and money) and the pain still comes and goes. Possible cause?
I want to take comfort in CT but even my GP says the submandibular and parotid are abnormal. I've been driving myself crazy for two months trying to rule out worst case scenerio stuff. I have no other text book symptoms such as weight loss, fever, sweats, etc. I have had some other, much less obvious skin lesions come and go throughtout this ordeal. But they never last more than a few days and are not blistery like original rash.
I got married just weeks before all this began and came home ready to start my life with my wife. We just bought a house and hope that kids are in the near future. But now i feel as if everything is on hold untilll I get this figured out. I am losing faith in the docs around here, as they continue to provide theory as opposed to taking steps to find some real answers. I see an oncologist/hematologist in a couple days. Hopefully that will provide some answers. In the meantime any advice/input would be most appreciated. Thanks and sorry to go on about myself. I realize some people have it much worse.

                I have many palpable supraclavicular and cervical lymph nodes but the sc scan only picked up 2. Why is that if I can still feel so much more? I had the ct scan with contrast.perhaps because the other nodes are to small?  Would a ct scan detect nodes that are matted together? What does matted mean literally stuck together? Or right next to eachother?

                40 year old male who recently had a tonsillectomy for moderate sleep apnea (things seem to be working out) on  November 06, 2008. Prior to having the proceedure I was on z pack of Antibiotics for a persistant cough (productive/no productive). The cough disappeared but reappeared a week after the proceedure. 

While recovering from the treatment, I developed Thrush (possibly from the antibiotics) and that was treated in about a weeks time. 

Two days ago, I noticed I would itch from time to time on my upper right arm close to my arm pit area. Each day the itching grew worse. Last night I felt a kinda pull/strain on the right right side of my chest muscle. The discomfort was fer benign, so I really didn't pay it any mind. 

Today while at work the itching was so bad that I finally took a look. I've got  several red swollen streaks radiating from my arm pit area. And when I raised my arm, there was discomfort in my arm pit area. I felt the area and noticed a mass/node swollen about 1 - 2 inches across. The area is visibly swollen upon sight. 

Could all this I've recently gone thru be related? Or should I have more serious concerns?

                Hi.  I am a 25 year old female with no current (known) medical conditions, and am not on any medications.  I had a CT scan a few weeks ago to check for an incisional hernia (came back negative) and one of my left inguinal lymph nodes was seen to be enlarged.  It turns out that this same lymph node was already enlarged two years ago, as seen on a CT scan I had when I had appendicitis.  At the time, the enlarged node was not even noted by the radiologist on the report, due to the fact that I was fighting infection at the time and a swollen lymph node was not anything out of the ordinary.  Now, two years later, the node is still enlarged, and has grown noticably.  It is currently 2.6 cm X 2.9 cm X 2.9 cm. It is too deep to be easily felt by the doctor, and does not seem to be causing me any discomfort.  I had a CT-guided fine needle aspiration performed last week, which has come back negative for cancer cells.  My doctor says that he does not know why the node is enlarged, but suggests a follow-up ultrasound in a few months to check for any changes.  I am wondering what other possible reasons for this enlarged lymph node there are . . . I am generally healthy, have no fever, no swelling, warmth, or redness around the node, etc. and this swelling appears to be limited to just the one node.  I'm still worried that there may be an uderlying malignancy that was not detected (although the surgeon took 6 samples from the node during the biposy to avoid the risk of a false negative.)  Any thoughts?  Should I seek a second opinion or just wait and see what the node looks like in a few months?  If there is no infection and no cancer, why has this node been enlarged and apparently growing for so long?  Thanks for your time!

I've had three blood tests and a chest xray and antibiotics. I have a slightly raised white cell count, and my platelets are up, originally was 431 and has dropped to 404. I have pain under my ribs on my left side and am waiting for an ultrasound but it could take eight weeks. Honestly, I feel so unwell but the doctors are brushing me off, treating me like i'm making it up, my xray was fine, the doctors even tried to convince me the chest and back pain was stomach pain. I thought the pain might have been caused by swollen lymph nodes, but they'd show up wouldn't they? Should I just leave it now? I mean lymphoma would have shown up by now right, and my white count is only a little raised? So, I can't decide, give up and see what happens or push the doctors for more tests?  Please, what do you think?

What in the world?  Please can you give me some idea?  Since CBC's are normal, if it is some kind of cancer it certainly can't be too serious can it? Thanks for any input and God bless you.  Rob.

                I have several palpable lymph nodes in my neck and collar bone area. In the collarbone area ItS bilateral and they feel like tiny balls the size of a pea maybe a little larger. I've had a biopsy of the largest node it was benign however I can still feel all these lymph nodes. I am going to get a second ct scan to see if the nodes changed and compare it with my first ct scan that was 5 months ago. My doctor said if they stayed the same or decreased its fine to say I just have palpable collar bone lymph nodes and it doesnt mean is cancer. Would you agree that if my second test shows no difference the biopsy was correct? There's no better test than the test of time right?  Do I continue to get to the bottom of this or just let it go? These palpable lymph nodes are my only symptoms; however they are in a dangerous spot.

I am very worried and wonder what it could possibly be. It is at the bottom of my skull. Could you possibly tell me if it is harmful or if I should be worried?

I feel fine. I exercise daily, run 4-5 miles 3 times/ week, spin, light weights. Have not had night sweats, fever, weight loss. Do not get sick easily. The only thing is last Nov I had my first ever yeast infection, and went on to have 4 more in 6 months.Starteed probiotics, have not had one since May 08. Other than mild proctitis I am healthy. 
I am a Nurse Practitioner, and have researched lymphopenia, but can't get anything to go on? 
My primary MD and the hemotologist do not feel conern over this. Hematologist told me to come back in a year unless I didn't feel well...Primary MD said it's nothing to worry about and he has many pts' who are lymphopenic. 

Do you have any suggestions? My only concern is that this is some sort of blood cancer. Has anyone every had decreasing lymphocytes, or low lymphocytes?

I'm truly at my wits end over this...any comments would be so appreciated.
Thank you

                Hi 
My daughter is 15 nearly 16 year old, and nearly 3 weeks ago started gymastics (tumbling classes) 
she had only been once a week for 2 weeks. Now She and I are really concerned as she is having joint pains and aches and after periods of sitting or climbing stairs she feels her legs are weak. She also stated she has a twiching nevrve above her kneecap. They started in her shin area and both knees at the same time, followed by her wrist and now her lower back. The pains in her shins seam to have settled but not the knee or lower back pains these pains are remitting they come and go, sometimes they come twice a day and each time last 1 hour or so, other times they come 4-6 times a day   These pains come and go. She has been worrying about bone cancer and blood cancer, which she does not seam to have any other symptoms. Due to her high stress level and how much she worrys could you please reply asap. 
Also its been 3 weeks nearly since they started and I have taken her to our doctor, whom seam to think its from trying gymastics, he stated to wait another 3 to 4 weeks and if it has not settled then he would run some tests. In his opion he did not think it was bone cancer or leukemia. He checked her throughly he felt her spleen and liver, checked for lymph nodes and checked for any bruises or fever. All was fine.Could you please try and put our mind at rest. I am worried due to reading lots of medical information on the net regarding joint pains and most talk about leukemia or bone cancer. 
Regards

                Husband had a bone marrow biopsy, and I have the results (I am a nurse in the system), but the hematologist is not quick in responding to our calls for explanation.  Once again we get to live thru a stressful weekend of waiting and not knowing what's going on, so I'm hoping I get can get a clue here.  

In a nutshell, he has absolutely no symptoms, but neutrophils have been low (0.1 up to 1.7 in the last ten weeks).  All other counts, tests, are normal.  Biopsy report says ""Granulopoiesis adequate and progressive to the band stage, but partially arrested at the band stage.""  Bone marrow band neutrophils are 23.0% and segmented neutrophils are 3.0%.  As I said, he's had no problems, viruses, bacterial infections in the past six months that we can think of.

However, about 18 months ago he had a prostate biopsy because his PSA was 4.3.  Results were negative, and PSA has since come down to 1.5, which seems a little odd to me because PSA doesn't typically go down for no reason at all.  He did not receive antibiotic treatment at the time.  So my question is, in lieu of the fact that his ESR is normal, could the neutropenia be caused by some asymptomatic prostate infection from months ago?

Any insight you can give me would be appreciated since this hematologist of ours isn't responding to our calls.  Thanks.

user_555864,Messi,/posts/Leukemia-and-Lymphoma-/Swolen-neck-lymph-nodes/show/564678,Swolen neck lymph nodes,"
                Alright, so, I've had a swolen lymph node both on the right and left sides of my neck for quite some time now, upwards of 1 1/2 years for sure. I read on a web site that constantly palpating them will keep them reactive and they will not return to their normal size, and since I do have a habit of doing this (like every 3 minutes!) I'm thinking that what happened is that I got some sort of infection, and the lymph node(s) swelled, and I noticed them when they were swollen, started playing with them (moving them around underneath my skin), and since then they have stayed the same enlarged size because of this. Now, I'm not sure if they are really swollen, they definetely are under an inch, I'd say less then a half an inch, but I can't find lymph nodes in those same places on other peoples necks when I try to, so I assumed their swolen. I haven't been sick for over a year now, not a fever, not the flu, not even a cold, so although I'm paranoid about it, I don't think I have lymphoma. Yesterday, when I read that palpating the nodes can keep them swollen, I decided to stop touching them, and I hope that it will go away within 4-6 weeks, and if not, I plan to visit a doctor. However, do you think that my current situation, with a seemingly obvious reason for the swelling and no other symptoms, warrants an immediate doctor visit?

Thanks

Since I have skin issues and dandruff from dry skin and itchy scalp can this cause my nodes to be palpable since I have had an itchy scalp for this long?  You cannot see my nodes just feel them when I push my shoulders all the way back.  I also suffer from excema but thats more on my stomach.  Thank you.

My blood test this week had a WBC rading of 84.4.  Can this affect the veins in my legs and arms and cause them to
swell up?

                I have an 11 year old daughter, through adoption, so I don't know her family history.  When she was 10, she noticed several cysts in one of her knee joints.  Later, the same type of cycts started to present in her wrists and elbows and thumb joint.  Her bio half brother has presented similar cysts in his groin that have been present for several months now.  The cysts in both kids are painful at times, which is why they were noticed in the first place, but not always.  They are sometimes moveable, to the point we can ""push"" them so far we can't feel them, but they always move back into their natural position.  Also, there are usually many cysts in one area and they seem to multiply, they also vary in size.

I first brought the knee cysts to my doctor's attention, he thought they were probably ganglions and dismissed it at that.  We saw him again for my son's cysts and he felt they were most likely lymph nodes, although he was concerned that they were sensitive and had been present for a while, so ordered blood work, he said it ""all came back normal.""

Does anyone think this is worth looking into further ro should I be happy with the diagnoses?

                I would really appreciate it if someone would take the time to talk with me because I am truly freaking out.  It all started with palpable lymphnodes in the collarbone area and posterier triangle.  I went to an oncologist/hemotolgist who did a full body ct scan with contrast which showed 4 enlarged lymph nodes.  The largest was 1.5cm x 1.9cm and my blood work came up perfect LDH everything great.  I pushed for a biopsy anyway.  They biopsied the largest lymph node with ultrasound guided  FNA AND core needle and ran it through flow cytometry.  Nothing was suspicious it was benign.  My doctor explained to me that in some people they are just palpable from old infections.  It is completely normal.  I decided to get a second opinion so I went to a top notch doctor in new york city who was literally rated number 1 hemotologist by 12,000 doctors.  He palpated all my nodes and explained to me that the cervical chain runs all the way to the supraclavicle area so it is not necessary a supraclavicle lymph node I am feeling.  He was no concerened at all.  

I am getting very good and finding lymph nodes and I find more each day but I am not sure if they are new or have always been there.  I am getting very worried. I feel great no symptoms at all just anxiety over these nodes.  I am 23 years old.  I have palpable lymph nodes in my supraclavicle area but they are not large and symmetrical I feel them on both sides left and right.  I also can feel  a few in my neck.  Should I go for another ultrasound becuase the radiation is becoming to much i think for someone my age.  My doctor also explained the scalp drains to the posterioer clavicle areas and i do have excema and itchy scalp.  Im going back to the doctor but should I be as concerned about this as I already am?

Is it normal for some people to have symmetrical collarbone lymph nodes palpable?  You cannot seem them adn I have to push my shoulders back to get to them but should I just assume I have cancer?

Could cancerous Non Hodgkins Lymphomas be removed instead of observing the watch and wait. What exactly is the purpose of the linguinal nodes and what are the consequences of its removal.

                My husband is 53 years old and in excellent health -- doesn't drink, exercises regularly.  He has a bicuspid aortic valve that is being managed with Lisinopril, and he had a prostate biopsy last year that came back negative, and since then, his PSA is within normal range.  Last month he had a routine physical and his wbc came back at 1.9 with neutrophil ABS at 0.4.  He has received no treatment thus far, the doctor has adopted a ""wait and see"" attitude and ordered weekly cbc's.  This last week's was: wbc at 2.8 and neutrophile ABS at 0.7 (down from 0.8 the week before).  All other counts are normal, it's just the neutrophils that are way off.  He has been tested for vitamine b-12 and folate deficiencies, HIV, ANA are negative, and we do not remember him having ANY type of viral infection except a slight cold maybe in early June.  Sed rate is 4.  He has no symptoms of illness whatsoever and feels ""perfect"".

Of course I'm worried about leukemia or MDS.  We see the hematologist next week, but she doesn't seem overly concerned like we are.  I would expect the next course to be a bone marrow biopsy, but how worried should I be about this neutropenia?

I am seeing an ENT in 2 days to have it aspirated.  I just felt it and it feels like it is pulsating as my pulse would.  My dentist did put me on an antibiotic for one week when I discovered node 2 weeks ago.  The swelling did not go down.  He then referred me to an oral surgeon who has referred me as stated above to ENT. Concerned and confused.  Thanks for any input.

                Hello to Everyone:
    I myself have CML, but someone has asked me about Hodgkins Lymphoma.  They have a young son who needs Vinblastine, and they have been told that it is not available in the United States.  I told her I would try to get some information for her.  I do not know what her doctor is doing for her son at this time.  She did say he is going through Chemo and Radiation.  I told her I would check on that medication to see if I could get some information for her.

                Hi,

I'm 24, male, non smoker, don't drink much. 10 weeks ago, I came down with a bout of tonsillitis, which I had all the usual symptoms for. I was prescribed antibiotics, and although they got rid of the whiteness on the tonsils, I noticed about five days into the course that my throat was beginning to feel sore again on the right side. The course of antibiotics finished, and I began to get neck pain on the same side. I returned to the doctor, who told me that it would go away within a week.

Since then, the neck pain has got gradually worse, and spread to both sides of my neck, and my shoulders. I also noticed a swelling below my ear around week four, and just behind my jaw. I have seen numerous doctors over this, most of whom said they ""couldn't feel anything"". Up until week five, I had on/off sore throats, and a constant need to 'pop' my right ear, but they seem to have subsided now. 

I now seem to have an increasing number of swollen lymph nodes in my neck, and one above my collar bone on the right hand side. Most people say my neck looks perfectly normal, but it feels like it's swollen to me, to the point now where to button the top button on a shirt causes me pain. My neck is painful almost all the time, with pain ranging from mild to severe (often made worse by exertion of any kind, even walking to the shops). The pain radiates around, but is almost always there in some form. I feel a little tired, have no fever or night sweats. In the past few weeks I have been having stomach pain, but it feels more muscular than actually in my gut, if that makes sense. I've also had an increased need to urinate, particularly in the morning. I wouldn't say my nodes feel huge, but they are definitely swollen. 

I've had a -ive HIV test @ 12 weeks since last sexual activity, a negative monospot, and three CBC's, all of which have come back normal, except for one last week, which showed a slightly raised white cell count (neutrophils). The doc I saw last week gave me a blood test for a huge number of things, and gave me a full physical. He did say I had a lot of swollen nodes in the neck, but not under arms or in groin, and that my liver/spleen were not enlarged. He told me that from the physical examination and from the bloodtests, a raised neutrophil count indicates bacterial infection, and that it is very likely that bacteria from the tonsillitis has spread into my nodes which is why i still feel so bad. He also told me that the lack of cancer cells in the blood, and the other perfectly normal blood tests ""rules out lymphoma 99%"". He seemed very confident that I didn't have anything serious, but he is continuing to see me until he finds out exactly what's wrong with me/I get better. I've seen about six docs in total, and including him, only two were able to feel my swollen nodes. None of them thought it was likely I had Lymphoma.

What I want to know is, does anyone think what I have sounds like Lymphoma, or can I relax? I've read that lymph nodes are painless when Lymphoma is present.. well mine aren't sore to the touch per-se, but I have intense neck pain, so I'm guessing that makes mine painful? I'm very scared and have been intensely stressed about this for pretty much two months now, so any advice is appreciated. I've never had anything that's lasted this long in my life.
Is it possible for bacteria to stay in your system and make you ill for this long? Does anyone think maybe my mono test was a false negative?

Thanks

                Hello - I am wondering how long I should watch a lymph node that is swollen before seeing a doctor. To date its been about a month that I have had a lymph node swollen in my neck. I also have a nose that will not heal. It is always mucousy and sore, its has been this way for over a year. Also when I swallow I feel like I have a lump in there and recently have had a harder time breathing. Like making my bed leaves me a bit winded or even talking. I don't have any green mucous or anthing like that. And have not been sick with a cold or anything. I also have a lump in my chest just below my collar bone that's been present for about 3 weeks. I have been putting heat and ice on the lump on my chest and taking ibuprofen but it has not gone down. 

Thanks for any responses.

I went to the doctor and he did some blood work that came back normal. About 1 year ago I started to get very fatigued, went to a different doc, did some blood work came back okay. 2 weeks ago went back due to a pain in my throat when i swallow, at the back of my tongue, it feels like something is caught and I have to forcefully swallow, and several swollen lymp nodes down R side of throat. Was referred to ENT.Had ultrasound that came back several benign cysts with debris, doc did not explain, saying it was normal for people to develop these. Just had Ct scan and upper gi. I have had acid reflux for 3 years. Ct scan says normal, but in the result it says small foci of decreased attenuation noted in right thyroid lobe. Doctors are brushing this off. Need something done, demanded FNA, doc says need more tests. HELP can't take this swallowing pain!!!

                I am a 40yr. old female.  I have had multiple health issues since my pregancies. I have had multiple surgeries on my heart, and I have alot of spinal hardware due to a burst fracture in the spine last year.  I have had several infections, mono 2x in the past, and mrsa in my pacemaker which had to be removed and relocated.  Ok, that's  my brief history.

Since the beginning of July I began feeling unwell, daily fevers ranging from 99.5 in am to 101 by afternoon.  Alot of sweating, sometimes at night requiring me to change my clothes, but during the day also.  My drs. suspected infection in either my pacer or spinal hardware.  I have been on 3 courses of antibiotics.  I had noticed over the summer lymph node enlargement, but assumed it was because I was unwell.  About 3 wks ago I felt my neck again and the lymph node was still swollen and MUCH larger. It is painless.  It is right under the end of my jaw.  When I saw my ENT last week, he said it was not supposed to be there, and that I needed a CTwith contrast and a biopsy asap.  I asked how he treats lymph nodes that were abnormal and he said he wasn't sure it was a lymph node, that it could be my parotid gland.  

Please tell me what you think.  If it is the parotid what are the odds of it being malignant, and what about lymphoma.  I guess I am wondering if this is most likely a malignant mass or benign?  Statistically what are my chances of this being malignant?
Thank you so much!

                My father is 82, and recently whenever he barely bumps his arm or leg, he has bleeding under the skin, and it looks just like when someone is on blood thinners and they barely bump themselves and get these large, dark red areas of bleeding under the skin. He is also very short of breath when walking. He had a dr. appt. a couple of weeks ago and blood work was done, and the dr. said he would see him in two months. The dr. said his heart and lungs were fine, so the only explanation I can think of for the shortness of breath would be a severe anemia or leukemia. The dr. has not called him about his blood work so my father is assuming that means it is all normal, but given the bleeding under his skin I don't think so. I tried to get him to call the dr. to find out his lab results but I think he is afraid to....Could he possibly have leukemia? He is not on blood thinners or aspirin, so I can think of anything else to account for all the bleeding under his skin....

                Hi. I have recently been getting a lot of cherry angiomas on my skin. My doctor said it is nothing to worry about, but they have develoed over the last month or so hundreds of them. Most of them are on my stomach and chest area but I have noticed now some very, very tiny ones on my upper arms and upper legs that are hard to see unless you really look close. I am worried because he did a CBC on me 3 days ago and my WBC is low at 2.8. When i compare this count to January of 2007, it was 5.5 then and in July of 2006 it was 5.0. Also my platelets worry me. they are in the normal range at 209 three days ago, but what concerns me is that in January of 2007 they were 231 and in July of 2006 they were 291. They are in the normal range but they are decreasing over the last 2 years or so. Is this anything to worry about. I am 31 year old female. I also have sweating and night sweats going on and also dizziness, headaches, body aches. My doctor thinks that some of these symptoms are anxiety related which I agree with but the white count concerns me since I have so many cherry angiomas appearing in such a short period of time. He thinks the white count is low because of a viral infection and I did have a cold about 3 weeks ago. The other thing I read is that platelet counts can become low from a lot of ibprofen use and also use of some antibiotics. I have been using a lot of ibprofen and aleve the last 4 or 5 months for headaches and body aches and I was on 27 days of Biaxin and then a ZPAK. Any help would be very appreciated. thank you.

                Hi.  I am a 29 year old female.  Non-smoker, non-drinker, average weight.  I have had this lymph node in the left side of my neck for as long as I can remember.  There is a smaller, softer one just below it which is movable and about the size of a pea.  The larger one is a little less than 1.5 cm. It does not hurt and it moves freely.  It is not soft and squishy, but it is not rock hard either.  Two years ago I was evaluated by an ENT for this node.  He examined me and thought it was ok but said I could go for a CT scan if I wanted.  I went for the scan and the report said that I had some top normal cervical chain nodes on the left side.  It said that there was not definate lymphademea or mass. The ENT said that he did not see any problems and he did not suspect cancer.  I still have this node.  It has not changed since my visit with the ENT.  

Recently, I have communicated with a few forum members and I began to wonder if I should get the node checked again since I still have it.  I did not want to unecessarily run to the doc because I have had other health issues over the last few years and I am tired of docs, stress, scans and unecessary radiation from the scans.  Also, as I have already had this node examined, I don't want to put myself through all of that again for nothing.  

I have no other symptoms except, once in a great while I will sweat at night but when I do it is during the day or two before my monthly cycle.  Also, almost every time I did sweat at night so did my husband, so I think the room may have been just warm.  The sweat was never drenching or constant.  It may happen before a montly cycle once or twice every two or three months.  

Also, as a teenager, I had tonsilitis frequently for about 3 years.  Every time I would stop an antibiotic, it would come back in a few weeks.  Eventually, they were going to take the tonsils, but then the infections stopped.  Also, on the left side I had a severe infection once in a tooth.  I was wondering if these things could have contributed to the node size and if re-evaluation is necessary.

Any advice is appriciated.

                I had triple by-pass surgery back in February, 2008, and had another angiogram back on September 8, 2008, as I am having alot of chest tightening and breathing problems.  The chest tightening and breathing problems will get worse if I do activities and even with just no activity at all.  In the last few weeks, even just sitting or lying down in bed will bring on chest tightening and breathing problems.  I also have pain just below the rib cage on both sides of the ribs and I notice it is worse on the right side.  Just recently, I noticed if I bend down, I get a sharp pain on the right side below my rib cage.  I am really worried as the angiogram I had on Sept. 8/08, showed my heart was in good shape---no blockages and the by-passes are fine.  I also had other tests on the heart such as echo cardiogram, stress test, prefusion study, etc. and they all showed I was fine.  In 2006, I did have an angioplasty on my left groin area due to blockage but this was cleared up with angioplasty.  I have lost over 20 pounds in the last six months even though I am eating normally and even eating more than I used to.  Back in July, 2008, I started experiencing alot of dizziness and lightheadedness when walking so my doctor has arranged for me to see a ear, nose and throat specialist as he thinks I also have an inner ear problem or problem with my equilibrium.  Recently, an ultrasound on my thyroid showed there is a nodule there and my doctor has ordered further tests to see about this nodule and why I am losing weight for no reason.  Could a thyroid problem be causing the chest tightening and breathing problems and pain?  Since I have such a strong history of blockages and family history of heart disease and artery disease, could I possibly have a blockage in another organ in my body close to the chest or even in my chest.  What could be causing these symptoms? I also start sweating for no reason, quite heavily at times and get very cold so I have to bundle up in a blanket.   Could cancer be a cause? I was a heavy smoker for 22 years, however, quit 12 years ago.  Any suggestions or help would be appreciated.

                Although I do not believe I have Lymphoma, I read a question in this forum that came closer to my symptoms than any other I have seen.  I am a 53 year old male.  Back in high school, I suffered a sports-related groin injury from which I developed a lump in the right groin.  I was checked out and found negative for hernia and was told that it was just a severe groin pull.  However, ever since I had tonsillitis in my early twenties, those lumps in my groin return whenever I get a fever.  They have been diagnosed as swollen lymph nodes but no treatment has helped.  Each time it happens, I have a painful side effect that has been getting worse with age.  It seems that the infected lymph node drains after a few days and just when I get over the flu, or whatever caused the fever, this drainage build-up collects in my penis and it turns black and blue and swells locally, usually on the same side as the lymph node (the right).  With each bout, the swelling has gotten worse, to the point now that I have experienced surface breakage due to the over-stretched skin.  I have moved and/or have had to change health care plans frequently, and each time a new doctor sees this symptom, they don't listen to a word I say and they test me for STD's.  I have never tested positive for any STD, (and this doesn't even look like any of the pictures I've seen of any STD) but by the time they get their results back, I am back to normal and they say they would really like to see me the next time this happens.  Gee, thanks for nothing.  Is there something I can do or say that will get someone to help me with this?

                I am undergoing tests on a large, hard lymph node on  my neck just under my jaw bone, just ahead of the end of the jaw bone.  During the fine needle biopsy they were unable to get a sample of anything as the Doctor said the mass was very fibrous.  I am having an ultrasound on Monday and then I will be back to my Doctor for the results.  He has told me that no matter what is found, the node will have to be removed as it is not normal.  It is quite large and hard but not really painful.  Could this be a sign of lymphoma or something similar?  My doctor seems concerned.  I am a 56 year old female with no family history of lymphoma however all of my paternal uncles and my father all died of cancer.  I know that you can not diagnose but I have no idea what this could be and I would just like a little heads up as to what is could be.
thanks

                Usually doctors do a FNA or core needle and if it comes up suspicious they do an excisional biopsy.  my friend just needed the FNA and she was diagnosed with Hodgkins so some do not need an excisional.  How did you get diagnosed?

Ive had FNA, core needle, and flow cytometry.

                Hello,
I am a 31 year old female and a few weeks ago I noticed an enlarged lymph node under my right ear in line with my jaw.  I told the Dr about it and she wasn't concerned (however, she rarley is).  It has not gone away and it seems to be stuck to tissue underneath.  I wouldn't call it stone hard, but it is not soft.  I do have night sweats (although I am getting my body back to normal after 4 pregnancies in 4 years).  I am feeling weaker, and more tired.  I also just got a new patch of eczema on my forhead in the last 5 weeks (is that the kind of itchiness associated with lymphoma?).  The patch is about 2 cm in diameter.  What should I do - I am EXTREMELY worried about it.  Thank you for any input!

                Hi,

I just recently had a well check and my blood work came back fine except for my white blood cell count was 2.9, which is low and my red cell count was just slightly low, 4.18 and my MCH 32.7 (slightly high).  My doctor wants to re-check in 2 months. He is going to run a B12 and a  folate (?) on the blood sample she already has.  The internet, although it provides a lot of useful information is also a scary thing.  I'm just wondering if you doctors out there think its okay to wait 2 months to re-check this or should I be more proactive and see another doctor or ask for a sooner re-test?  My doctor doesn't seem concerned because I am, otherwise very healthy, and the CBC looks really good except for these tests.  FYI my platelet count is 227, lymphocytes 41.6%, etc.all fall in the normal percentage range.  Also, is Shark Liver oil (capsules) a good thing to take to increase the WBC?  If so, how does it affect cholesterol?  Thanks so much for your help.

                Friday I was diagnosed with SLL / CLL from the a bone marrow aspriation and biopsy.  My  oncologist was surprised at the disgnosis, I guess because my white count had only been around 15 to 16 for the most part. I have had some symptoms, but he was still not aparently alarmed.  My pathology report came back reading
76% Lymphocytes
22% mature neutrophils
0.5% basophils,
0.5% eosinophils 
1% monocytes.
It said the leukocytes are increased in number and many small mature lymphocytes are identified. Lymphocytes with prominent nucleoli are identified.
 Megakararyocytes are increased in number an enlarged.
RBC 4.08
Platelet262
Lymphocyte 61
WBC 16.3
SEGS 36

Also I can feel lymph nodes under my armpits if I look for them.  I am very good at finding these things because I am a severe hypocondriac.  The ones under my armpits are the same size on both sides and are mobile and about the size of a pea also.  I also can feel lymph nodes in my groin probably about 4 of them.  They are also about the size of a pea but maybe a little smaller and more elongated and thin.  I am concerned because I have been able to feel these for a long time like probably a couple of years.  I have been tested for hiv and it is neg been tested 3 times so am sure thats not it. My main question is how come I can feel these thing.  Does it sound like lymphoma.  Please answer as best as possible thanks.

This was just my last count.. these have varied through the past several months.  But the WBC has stayed mostly up aroun 15 to 18 the entire time. 
The bone marrow results should be in this Friday...I am so anxious that it is killing me.  I had back surgery 6 yrs ago and have had problems in that area for a while but my oncologist doesn't seem to think that has anythnig to do with the white count being elevated.  I may just be one of those with leukocytosis.  I know I will find out some things on Friday, but can anyone out there tell me anything about this?  Other symtoms include headaches, nightsweats (occassionally), itching on my arms, and horrible back and hip pain.

                I wrote a while back explaining that this crazy journey had begun with some really bad headaches during the night and some swollen lymph nodes in my neck (that by the way have deminished).  My GP did a CBC and  put me on a Z Pak of strong antibiotics in case there was some infection.. My white count came back at 18,000. He had me come back after the round of anti's and test again and my counts were still up at 16,7.  He referred me to an oncologist/hemo...who has put me through the ringer.  Immediately wanted to rule out Hodgkins, which he did, by CT scans of the chest , abdomin, and pelvis. In the course of this, a tumor was found in my liver, but an ultrasound showed that it was a hemangioma, which is benign. The dr. said that is not the cause of the high white count. He said if the next count was high he wanted to do a bone marrow aspiration to rule out CLL...so I was sent to the lab for blood and urine testing...When the results came back the blood count had dropped between 13 to 14, so he decided to wait 3 weeks to test again...No bone marrow test yet...After 3 weeks we did the blood and urine test again...urine clean..no infection...blood back up to 16...No sign of infection anywhere.  He decided to do a CT scan on my head since this began with headaches, and by the way the lymph node in the neck do not appear swollen any longer.. I have been so frustrated. CT scan on my head was ok, but he wants to do an MRI now to make sure there are no aneurisms.. That is all fine, but I am concerned about this white count that has been abnormal for several months with no sign of infection. I have never had a problem with my blood before. I have read up some on CLL and a lot of people have white counts in the lower ranges, from 12 to 20.. I have occassional night sweats, still have headaches, and always tired.  I don't know if the fatigue is just from stressing over all of this or what.. My parents both had cancer, my cousin had leukemia, many uncles had cancer...it's all over my family.  By the way...I finally had the bone marrow aspiration and I guess biopsy, too.. I know he took a piece of bone.    I guess that even if the news was not so good, it would be better than this not knowing.    Any insight?   Thanks for listening.

                Hi.  I am 41 yr old female who is being treated for SLE (lupus).  I am currently on 15mg prednisone daily (down from 20mg) and inbetween this time I began to feel really lousy - no appetite, horrible, drenching night sweats (particularly my head would be soaked), crazy itching on my legs and feet - really deep, like cannot get at the itch, low grade fevers.  Because my doc thought I was in a flare, she put me on a 40mg taper.  I still felt sick and then noticed that my lymph nodes were really swollen in my groing.  They did not hurt.  I am now back on 15 mg., but am still suffering the symptoms (I forgot to mention CRAZY fatigue, and really really weak - for weeks now).  Today I noticed a swelling in my right armpit, the same side as the groin swelling.
The only other symptoms IVe had that Im not sure is even related is a really full-feeling belly, that has really bad pain that comes in waves.  I have no digestive problems.  Oh yeah, one more symptom - really bad swelling in eyes and ankles/legs/feet.
Now, I know some of this could be caused by lupus or prednisone - but this doesnt feel like my normal lupus.  I just feel like something else is going on...
Should I see the doctor about it?  I know my lupus doc (rheumie) wont even pay attention.  If its not clearly related to my lupus, then he shuts off.  I am supposed to be starting Imuran soon as well (immunosuppressnat) and that scares me - especially if my immune system (or lack thereof) is not working well already. 
Dont knowif it matters, but my last blood work  (last week) showed elevated white count (has been for 6 months), low RBC, low HGB, low HCT, high sed rate and high CRP.  Dont know if this matters , but i thougt Id put it in anyway.

I woudl be so grateful for any advice you could give me.  I have to see the doc this week anyhow, and I jsut want to know if I should bother even mentioning it.
Thanks for any help ou can give me!

However, now I've been getting huge waves of fatigue along with cysts on my ovaries. I went into my gyncologist and she determined that the cysts were causing me discomfort but essentially it was a bone issue. When she did an internal exam she touched my hip bone and I felt extream pain, I vommited and nearly passed out. She scheduled me for a bone scan and an ultrasound a week out. Now since my appointment, my leg my left leg has been for the most part numb, and when not numb very painful. I was reading up on possible causes to the pain and leukemia seemed to pop up everytime. I get random waves of fatigue where I have to sleep if only for 5 minutes, this happens almost randomly but it seems to occur more often when I'm driving. Along with that, my neighbors dog brought in fleas and they migrated up into my appartment and this was over 2 months ago and my body cannot heal it's self, along with extream sensitivity to bruising.  If anyone has any ideas please let me know.

                Hello everyone. About a week ago I was diagnosed with Hodgkins Lymphoma. Even though they are not 100% and they need a second opinion on my biopsy, they are 90% sure that I have hodgkins lymphoma and almost certain it is stage 2.

Even though it was devastating news, I feel it is not all bad, as at least it is cureable. However the problem is that I am getting married in June and have not started my chemo yet. I am not going to delay my wedding as everything has already been booked, the cards have been printed and my honeymoon is booked. I am hoping from my first shot of chemotherapy I will recover and have enough energy to get on with my wedding. I hope I am not too unrealistic.

Just wanted to know anyone else's experience with stage 2 hodgkins and how they reacted to the chemo. I think they are going to go give me ABVD (or something like that).

I also am experiencing alot of generlised itching. I have been suffering with this for about half a year now. It was from my itching that I discovered that I had lymphoma. Has anyone else suffered from itching? Also any tips on how to get rid of it? Or how long it took to get rid of it after chemo?

Any experiences or advice would really help me. I really would like to know how people coped. 

FYI I am a female in my mid twenties.

                I have been not feeling well for months now and after many doctor visits, it seems as they get closer to a diagnosis I become more confused. (Many symptoms but in order to make this short and to the question, I will not list them.)

I was recommended to see an ENT because of a painless swollen lymph node on the side of my neck that I noticed while washing my face a few months back.  After the ENT listened to my symptoms and felt the lymph node, he decided to do a chest X-Ray, MRI of my head w/contrast, CT scan of my neck w/contrast, a CBC and sed rate.

My results:
MRI- Normal
Chest X-Ray- Normal
CT Scan- I forgot exactly what it read, but everything was listed as normal.  It read that the lymph node that is swollen was indeed bigger, (I am pretty sure 29mm, and I read something about the other ones around it being level 2 and 3.)  It said that none of them showed any signs of necrosis.(GOOD, right?!)  And it ended saying lymph nodes of this size were not abnormal for a girl my age. 
My CBC was not normal.  It read that my WBC was low- 3.3, and with differential, my lymphs were at 0.6.
My sed rate was zero.

The ENT referred me to a Hematologist/Oncologist.  I saw her on Thursday afternoon and had numerous blood tests done that day.  She said that we don't what is really going on with the lymph node till it is more closely looked at.  I got a phone call this morning telling me I have an appointment with an Otolaryngologist tomorrow morning.  I now understand that is an ENT that specializes in surgery. 

Could I be getting my lymph node removed?  I thought that was only necessary if they needed to do a biopsy.  And since the CT scan showed 'no signs of necrosis', then it can't be lymphoma, right? So there would be no need to do a biopsy.  And with my wbc being low, I always heard that is the opposite of lymphoma/leukemia, which is when your wbc multiplies.

Thanks!

I have over the passed year been suffering with stomach problems (bad hart burn) and take medication to reduce reflux. Over the passed 6 months I have been very tired and sleep when I get home from work for about 4 hours and then I will wake up for about 4 hours and then go to bed for the night at about midnight. Most nights I will sleep fine but every night I get hot and sweaty, not bucket loads but just over clammy. I get dizzy a lose energy very quick. I have dizzy spells and some times need sugar boosts. I have had about three diabetes test that have all been normal. I get bad headaches, have a swollen belly like I am full and it is very uncomfortable. I was diagnosed with gastric two months  ago but I have had this before and it was different. I did not have diarrhea it was soft and lost red blood. But that all healed over about two weeks and have been good for about 6 weeks. I went to the doctor again about my stomach and he done loads of tests. He told me to call in about a week for results. But this morning he called me with the results and said that all came up pretty much ok but my white blood count was quite high. He said I would need another blood test to check them again. But he did not ask me to come in to the surgery tomorrow which is when they do them but he will send me a letter with an appointment. He seemed very vague on the phone, why did he just not ask me to come in and have it done tomorrow like before???

I posted here because it had similar Q???? hope this is ok 

PS male, age 33. do not do a very active job but even getting up to wash the dishes can tire me out. 

Any help with this would help.

                I was just diagnoised with PLC Pityriasis Lichenoides Chronica (skin biopsy)

Diagnosis:
Right anterior thigh - patchy lichenoid and slight spongiotic dermatitis with rare eosinophils
Note: The differential diagnosis includes a drug eruption, pityriasis lichenoides spectrum disorder and, less likely, pityriasis rosea.

Microscopic description:
There are slight hyperkeratosis including small mounds of parakeratosis and a predominantly superficial perivascular and patchy lichenoid inflammatory cell infiltrate consisting of lymphocytes, histiocytes and rare eosinophils that obscures the dermo-epidermal junction in foci where there are occasional necrotic keratinocytes. There are extravasated erythrocytes. There is slight spongosis.

The dermatologist put me on Tetracycline 500 mg 1 2x /day for 4 wks
and then 1 1x/day for another for weeks.
wants to see me in 3 months and then wants to follow up every six months with blood work for lymphoma etc.
Do people usually get Lymphomas with PLC? Can I be assured I don't have lymphoma right now? Anything else I can do? Thank you.
Best Regards.

                I was diagnosed with low platelets (60,000) 8 years ago. A marrow biopsy was negative as well as a muriad of tests for auto immune diseases including lupus. All of my other cell counts were normal. To this day my platelets have fluctuated anywhere from in the 60,000's to the low 100,000's. I still have had no other symptoms. Is it still possible to have a lymphoma or leukemia with no treatment and no other symptoms after this long? Could the marrow biopsy have been a false negative?

                I was diagnosed with CML and given Gleevec 400 ml. After taking gleevec for 2 weeks doctor took additional blood test. My WBC dropped from 36.5 to 7.1 and all other blood counts came down to normal range. I'm wondering if gleevec could give such fast hematological response or I was possibly misdiagnosed originally. I don't and didn't have any symptoms, my spleen and liver weren't enlarged, no enlarged lymph. Should I get second opinion asap? Please, help me.

                What does this mean? I was initially diagnosed with Pityriosis Rosea and later when it came back again after 7 weeks, the dermatologist did a skin biopsy. I just called for results. They were looking for PLC, but I guess it was negative for it. The nurse said the doctor will talk to me when I go in for my follow up appointment. He said it may be drug induced since there was eosinophil found in my biopsy. I told the nurse I don't take any drugs/medications ie. and he asked what about vitamins. I told him no vitamins either. Would someone please help me what all this means? Lymphoma other diseases? :(

                I felt what feels like a lump or actually more like a line of cartilage or muscle or something about an inch long 1/4 wide, running vertically under my skin, on the back left side of my neck, under the hair line. It is not petruding through the skin. I have no pain in this area, and have no other symptoms. I am 26, have never smoked and rarely drink and have no family history of anything. I suspect that it may have always been like that except I have just noticed now. The adjacent right side feels normal. I am also curious to know if cancer on the back of the neck is similar to other neck cancers, because all the articles I found on this, group all neck cancers as one i.e.that there pretty much (85%) caused by smoking drinking etc, or can cancers that occur in the back of the neck, have seperate causes?
Thanks.

I have been to see my local GP about several symptoms: Excesive Fatigue, Severe night sweats, swollen stomach to name a few.  My major concern is the night sweats as they are drenching.  Originaly he put it down to Chronic Fatigue (have previously had EBV).  After seeing him again about the night sweats he sent me for a CT to rule out Lymphoma.  The results state: Anterolateral to the right lobe of the thyroid there is a hypodense structure measuring appx 3.5cms in its greatest diameter.  Can anyone shed some light on what this would be as I don't see him for another week.

                Hi my name is Sue.
In Jan my 40 year old husband started having night sweats. They got so bad that after a few weeks we went to the doctors and were sent to see a consultant. He sent him for an ultra sound scan. Half way through the scan they stopped it and said he needed a CT scan. This was done on his gallbladder. we went back to see the doctor and were told he had sludge in his gallbladder and they would remove it. He was checked for tb which was ruled out. When bloods were removed for testing a massive yellow bruise appeared on his arm which we blamed the tecnician's method for this

He had the op in March to remove the gallbladder. The night sweats carried on. he also started having breathing difficulties, these would come on for no apparent reason, they were not unlike the symptons for asthma, our GP gave him an inhaler, The next thing was an itching all over his throat, again we put this down to the asthma or maybe hayfever

Six weeks ago a lump appeared in the middle at the bottom of his back, the doctor said it was a cyst. He then started to get very tired and lathargic and lost his appetite. Next he started with tummy pains around the site where the gallblader was removed from his lower back also started to give him a lot of pain.

Last weekend he was very tired and not well at all, the night sweats were bad although he does not get these every night. On Monday a tiny red spot appeared in his chin, it started to bleed and we could not stop it, it bled so much and for over a hour, we just thought we had stopped it and it started again. The other strage thing is his temperature, he is hot one minute and cold the next, this has only come on in the last couple of weeks. On Tuesday we decied it was time to sort this out once and for all.

We made a appointment with the GP. She examanined him and said his liver was very enlarged, she also examanined his back when she touched his left side he nearly shot through the roof it was painful. She checked him for swollen gland but did not say if she found any. She said she was very concerned and made us an appointment for Thursday with a specialist.

We arrived for the apponitment, the doctor gave him a full exaimation, and took all his history, he then told us that he thought is was Lymphoma, we were so shocked. He had bloods taken and full CT scan is booked for monday, the doctor said this will not show Lymphoma but will show any swollon glands and point them in the direction of which gland to take a biopsy from.

What I am finding hard to belive is that this could have been missed in March when they operated on him to remove his gallblader. Also how can the doctor come to this diagnosis by just examination and history. Can any one throw any light on this, we are both in total shock and just want the weekend over. What happens now? how is Lymphoma diagnosed? with the info we have is it possible to identify if it could be hodgkins or non hodgkins or the level/stage of the disease or is this determined from tissue samples. If any one has any answers I would be very gratfull.

                I had three grandmal seizures in a period of about a week, my doctor sent me to a neurologist who did an MRI with and without, and MRA and an EEG. My MRI came back with enlarged adenoids 1.7cm, and nothing else. My MRA came back with an anyurisum of 3 to 6 mm. I have one doctor freaking out about that as I have a family history of anyurisums. The rest are freaking out about my adenoids as I have itching, fatigue and horrid night sweats. I am going to an ENT about the adenoids on Monday. My questions are these> 1. What are the odds that lymphoma would start or present first in the adenoids (never had a problem with them or my sinus area at all until last winter) and 2.what do they do to test for it(subquestion>will the ent automatically send the adenoids out for testing or should I request it?) And 3 how long will it take to find anything out?
My Mother died two years ago from lung cancer that spread to the brain, my boyfriends mother died 12 years ago from another type of cancer. We are both in a major panic that can not be good for either one of us. 
Here is my basic medical history. 36 year old white female with factor V leiden blood disorder on coumidan for this.
Bi-polar disorder on Lithium for this. I also take Selenium to combat the hair loss from the Lithium (yes it works well for me. I am growing hair on my head in places that I never really had much at all.)
About 10 months ago I started having a spell that I couldn't keep food down or water down well for almost three months. I lost about 16 to 20 pounds in a months time. The doctors couldn't find a cause for it phyically and stated that it was stress and put me on nerve pills for a time. I still have an upset stomach a lot of the time but have learned to live with it and work around it when possible. About 8 months ago I started to notice that I had a stuffy nose and a slight cough that was in my throat not my chest. The Doctor said allergies or dry heat (it was in the winter) were causing it. They never stopped and in some ways only got worse. 
If I hadn't had the seizures we most likely would have continued to say allergies. 
In the past I have had more trouble with not being able to sleep and needing sleeping pills to get any amount of good sleep. Now All I want to do is sleep. If I am up for an hour or two I feel like I need to go back to sleep and have no desire to eat. 
This has been going on for a month now with no answers yet. As far as the anyurisum, goes I am supposed to see a doctor about a coiling procedure soon.  They say that it is small and if not for the family history they would just have me come back in a few months, scan it again and see if it is any bigger, if not then leave it alone again. But since I do have a horried family history for these things they want to do the coil to stop it from getting bigger. 
My fear is the lymphoma.

                Hi.

I posted this question on the thyroid community too because I have no idea what is going on with me. :0(

My family has a high cancer occurance in it and because of it, I have been a pin cushion for anything wrong. Well, I took a break from seeing a Dr. 5 yrs. ago for my thyroid. I have a thyroid nodule but when it was last tested about 5 or 6 years ago, it was determined to be a hot nodule. Okay, great. no big deal. Well, then the neck bulge came on sometime in the last *sigh* two years or so. I kept forgetting about it because it isn't painful, it's just...there. Well recently I thought I was going through menopause because of some of the symptoms I am experiencing (hot flashes, night sweats, moodiness, so tired, out of breath-never smoked, achy and an all over 'blah' feeling) so the OBGYN does a blood draw and says my thyroid was normal as were my hormone level but stressed that I NEEDED to get my thyroid nodule re-checked. Well, I've read many times over that a nodule very rarely causes any issues especially cancer so I never worried any more about it. I finally made an appt. with an endocrinologist and she did a full blood screening (all normal) and ordered an MRI of my neck and an ultrasound of my thyroid. Well I had the MRI earlier this week and they called me on the results today and stated that there is a 'legion' that measures 14mm but neither my Dr. nor the Radiologist can determine whether or not it is on my thyroid or if it is an enlarged lymph node. Isn't that odd? I would think that an MRI could decipher between the two?! Also, what is a 'legion'? Whenever I google it, everything comes up with brain legions and MS. I know they didn't scan my brain, so I'm sure it isn't MS. So now they are waiting for my ultrasound next week to determine what it is. Is it safe to assume that this isn't a cyst? 
I apologize for posting this question here. I have no idea if my problems are anything at all to do with lymphoma, I just know that enlarged lymph nodes is a symptom and with my family history I'm probably becoming a hypochondriac. :0\

Thank you in advance for any help.

                Hi all,

About 5 months ago I started noticing a lump on the back of my neck, so I went off to the doctors and she advised me to monitor it. A couple of weeks later I noticed two lumps at the stop of my groin both in the exact same place on either side. I thourght nothing of it and went on holiday only to come back with Impertigo. That was three months ago and I still have the enlarged lymph nodes in both areas (groin and neck). Recently I have been getting the occasional stiff neck, and sometimes feel really tired with little energy. I went for a full blood test and throat swab and it came back negative. However, I have read that blood tests do not show up any signs of Lymphoma or the alike, is this true?

The lumps are still there, dont seem to be getting any smaller and I was wondering whether or not is was the dreaded C?

Regards

I know strange, but I have also started itching all over, I feel really tired, but that could be due to the fact I am not sleeping very well, I don't know if this is related but I have always been a bit dyslexic but just reciently I am finding that has become a lot worse I having to re type all the time and have to double check what I have written 3 4 times, and I have the memory of a gold fish. I live in Dubai, having moved from Florida 6 months ago although I am british. 
I have no medical insurance which is why I haven't gone to doctors.

                Dr. Paul,
I would like to know if there is any connection between the low iron and b-12 to leukemia?  I have woken up twice this week with night sweats in the neck area. I have a swollen area on my neck and my temp is usually 97.6 but it has been fluctuating around 99.2 to 100. is it unusal for the fever and swelling to come and go??    I also noticed a rash on my torso and back. I am having a pet scan and sono this week will the pet scan be able to tell if it's leukemia or lymphoma.  thanks again for your valued opinion.

I was recently diagnosed with CLL after a routine exam. Is there anything that a person can do on one's own in the area of diet, vitamins, supplements, etc. during wait and watch to try to fight this thing? And any other lifestyle change or therapy?

                Ok, here goes...


I'm a suffering hypocondriac/obsessive compulsive. My life is miserable most of the time. I have panic attacks and contemplate suicide often.

I was in the army last year (05-08) and right before I left I had an HIV test. They sent me the results last year and it said negative (even showed my mom).

Anyway.. around that same time I felt a hard lymph node in my armpit, its about the size of a uh... jelly bean. I went to the doc back in oct of last year and he palp'd it and didn't feel anything. He said to relax and it would go away. So I just forgot about it. Well last month I was washing my armpit and I felt it AGAIN! I don't think it ever disapeared. 

So I went back to see him 3 times this month and he tried again but didnt feel it, so I had to feel it and put his finger on it and then he was like ""oh, I feel it"". He said swollen lymph nodes are generally A)Nothing to worry about, B)An infection/virus or C) Cancer. He told me not to worry and put me on Amoxicillian. Well... the thing is, I sometimes, almost everyday get this general pain under my armpit. Like... its like an aching pain, but the lymph really doesn't hurt when I touch it. So the day I left the doc, I began to feel around my armpit again and I feel a small, small little tiny lymph node lower than my armpit. On my side, about level with my nipple. 

I'm 22 male, and I started ground fighting (jijitsu) again, and boxing, which is around the time the pain started to come back this last month and I noticed the lymph. I bring up HIV because I read it's a symptom of it, along with lymphoma, cat scratch (i have cats, have been scratched) among others. I've been taking the Amoxiciilan for about 5 days now, and I still feel the lymph nodes. I don't really feel sick at all, I get diareah sometimes when I drink milk and eat cheese. I work out a lot, sleep well. 

I'm going NUTS. N-U-T-S!!!!

I have no idea why my lymph nodes hurt, and the doc told me to come back next week for a follow up. I can't wait, but I dont want to bug him. Now my mind is playing tricks {""well I might have read the HIV card from the Army wrong, and it was pos, or the - meant something else, or it was a false neg). Or that I have cancer now. And Im checking every little thing I feel, and do. Im just literally losing my mind in fear. I don't know what to do. Logic says I'm okay, but my mind says I have hodkens lymphoma, or HIV. 

I mean I've had like 5 blood tests just last year in the army for random stuff. I really dont think I have aids. I've even gained 30 lbs this last year since leaving the army, and the last time I had unprotected sex, 1 and only time, was 2 years ago. So I mean... Im using logic here.... but if I had lymphoma, then hmm... then I'll be screwed and probably die. But I do work out a lot, boxing, push ups, arm bars, punched in the stomach, etc. Maybe my deodarant is causing the lymphs to stay swollen. But why the pain? The dull aching shocking pain sometimes? Hmm... my mind is going a mile a minute, im losing it. man man., help me someone. Help me get peiece of mind. Please.... please.............

                Hi there,

About five months ago I noticed I had some swollen lymph nodes in my groin. The nodes are on both sides of my groin. The one on the left side is about .5 cm in size and the one on the right is just below 1 cm in size. Their consistency changes from time to time. If I poke at them they tend to get firm and rubbery but if I leave them alone for long enough they seem to get softer. They are extremely mobile as well - not at all attached the to surrounding tissue. I have no other symptoms. At times I get chest pains but they go away within 5 minutes or so - I've had that before in my life as well. And I've had some itching around my ankles and feet - but I think that it's from bug bites mainly. I don't have any fevers or night sweats or anything. I have been a bit tired as of late sometimes, but that may be just because I am constantly worried about this. I am still very active and don't get worn out if I do anything very active. About a month ago I went to the doctor and he told me not to worry about them and to come back if they got any bigger. I continued to worry so a few weeks ago I went back and he said to put my mind at ease he would send me to a surgeon, but he said ""I would be shocked if they found anything"". So I went to see the surgeon and she was not concerned at all, but she said she would give me a prescription for a CT scan of my chest and pelvis for my own benefit and to make sure everything was fine - but she said she was very confident that nothing was wrong. I am currently waiting for my insurance to OK the CT scan and I am driving myself crazy with worry. Does this sound like something I should be worried about? Even though I've had two doctors be completely unconcerned with my nodes based on their size, consistency and bilateral nature I am still concerned about lymphoma. Oh, I also forgot to mention I had a CBC done and my levels were all perfectly normal. My main question besides if my symptoms sound concerning is: What is the average size and consistency of lymph nodes affected by lymphoma? Are pea size or smaller lymph nodes normal for a 20 year old male? I have always had very reactive lymph nodes. Ever since I was a kid. Anyway, please let me know if this sounds normal or if there is something fishy about all of this. Thank you very much.

                About three months ago I started felling relly tired despite aduacate rest. I did start working full time and I had only work one day a week previously. I have more energy now, but I have some bruises on my shins only that I can't neccesarily explain. They could be from work but I don't remeber getting them. I had very small amount of blood in my stool a few days ago. I pricked my finger and it stopped bleeding within 2 minutes, is that normal? No fever, infection, pain, etc. but I am still fairly concerned. If it was acute wouldn't I be dead by now without treatment or wouldn't I feel worse? Could it be chronic? I am 19, white, male.

                My 12-year old had Epstein-Barr last year and recurrent mono for 9 months. 10 days ago she began complaining of a sharp, intense, twisting pain to the left of her belly button. The pain was so bad she had trouble walking. I took her to the ER. Her stomach was tender to the touch. A CAT scan was ordered. It was negative. The doctor suspected an injury or infection, and we went home. The pain continued to come and go, but not as severely. Yesterday the pain came back severely. I took her to the doctor. The doctor ordered blood work and some kind of scan- I think maybe a barium x-ray? She had radioactive material injected into her blood stream and they took pictures of her abdomen. The test was to look for mesenteric diverticulitis. It was negative. The blood work was also negative. No sign of any infection, and only a few abnormal white blood cells. (I asked because these abnormal white blood cells were supposed to be indications of the mono continuing the last time she had her blood drawn).

I am worried about Lymphoma because of the 9-month bought with Mono she had and the severe abdominal pain. My question is whether the CAT scan and other scan she had yesterday rules this out. If not, what does she need?

                Hi,

I'm a 24 yo, normally healthy male, non smoker, not a big drinker. Over five weeks ago, I came down with what I think was (and what was diagnosed as) tonsillitis. I was given antibiotics. Had usual symptoms of very sore throat, white covered tonsils, fatigue, mild fever/chills for a day or two. The whiteness of the tonsils subsided soon into the antibiotics, but about five days into antib's, my throat started to go sore again on one side, and I noticed a lump in my neck, underneath and behind my ear/above the angle of my jaw.. I think this is the paratid gland?? 

The lump seemed to grow a little over a couple of days, but has now been the same size (I think) for a couple of weeks. It feels quite hard, doesn't really move, it isn't really visible to others but I can feel it (it might be around the same size as the last joint on an index finger, i.e the one with the finger nail on it) . My neck has also been feeling swollen and very painful/tight on the same side, like the muscle of the neck is swollen almost.

At the weekend, I noticed the area just above my collarbone on the same side now feels a bit swollen too, and the node in it feels more prominent than the other side. I've still been getting a sore throat on and off since the tonsillitis, which only just seems to be easing now, but still flares up sometimes. Occasionally I get stomach pain, but not all the time, and it is more a quick sharp pain than a prolonged one.

I've been to the docs a couple of times, they said the inside of my throat looks fine, doc felt my neck, round my collarbone, stomach, groin etc last thursday and said she couldn't find any major cause for concern, that it was probably a virus working it's way out of my system. I'm waiting on CBC and monospot blood test results this week.

Does anyone think any of this could be a sign of lymphoma or some other cancer? Is it normal or possible for something like that to start with (or start by looking like) tonsillitis? And does anyone think it could be glandular fever (mono) still in my system (do these symptoms match mono after 5 weeks or should it be going if it's that)? I really hope it's glandular fever (mono) but it's been over five weeks now and my neck ache and swollen node don't seem to be going away, and with this new one round my collarbone I'm starting to convince myself I've got lymphoma. I'm really worried, I can't sleep, and keep having panic attacks. If it was lymphoma would it be much more prominent swelling than this? I've felt a bit tired over the five weeks, but apart from the tonsillitis stage I've not had any other symptoms.. no nightsweats, weight loss etc.

Any advice would be appreciated, anyone, please just tell me something. I feel like I'm on the verge of a breakdown. Should I wait for the blood test results to rule out mono before getting so concerned?

user_439037,BionicBabe,/posts/Leukemia-and-Lymphoma-/Enlarged-lymph-node-cyst/show/603895,Enlarged lymph node/cyst?,"
                I have had an enlarged lymph node in my neck (under jaw line between cheek and ear) for at least ten years, probably closer to 15 years. It came about after a bout of either strep throat or mononucleosis and when I asked my then doctor (at Kaiser Permanente) about it, he responded that it was scar tissue from an infection. It has never decreased in size and only increases slightly in size when I'm sick with a sore throat or tonsilitis. It gets a little tender when I'm sick, otherwise it does not hurt. It is about 2 cm as best as I can measure and feels like a round rubbery bouncy ball. I can move it back and forth between my fingers. I have always worried about this node and have mentioned it to several doctors, none of whom have ever seemed concerned in the least about it. However, recently, for a variety of reasons I am more bothered by it, but mainly probably because I've had one cold/sinus infection/sore throat after the next for the past 5 months and I seem to be more aware of it. I recently saw an ENT who said it might be some kind of congenital cyst (he did not mention cancer), and he is ordering a CT scan of my neck. While awaiting insurance approval for this CT scan, I am second guessing whether or not the CT scan is really necessary, given the radiation exposure (this year I've already undergone cardiac catheterization and EP study as well as the implant of an ICD...I think both procedures use x-ray technology, in addition I've had 4 chest x-rays).  Is it possible this lymph node could be some kind of lymphoma or other cancer and that is why my doctor ordered the CT scan, or if it is a congenital cyst does it even need to be treated? Aside from the node causing me worry, I'd rather leave well enough alone and not expose myself to unnecessary radiation. I've been reading all about the CT radiation exposure and see that it is equivalent, or close to equivalent, to Japanese folks exposed to the atomic bomb, many of whom developed various cancers. Or should I be most concerned about this node (or whatever it is) and getting it diagnosed without regard for the risks? I have no knowledge of any other enlarged nodes on my body. I have lost 16 pounds in the past 5 months (however due to the stress of the diagnosis of my heart condition, the caring for my two young children,  and a changed diet, this may be explainable). Aside from that, I have no other symptoms associated with lymphoma that I'm aware of. I do have frequent infections in my sinuses, throat and tonsils and at some point in the future may have a tonsillectomy. The reason I worry about CT scan, is I'm only 34 and with my ICD, I will probably have repeated exposure to X-rays in the future and want to limit as much exposure as I can.  I have put a call in to my doctor with my concerns, but not sure if/when I'll hear back. Thank you!

Symptom overview:  Shortness of breath, fatigue, cough, neurological issues (speech, short term memory) congestion, dizziness/faitness for over year.  ENDO noted to look at Lymphoma due to High Vit. D 1.25 and high calcium.

Labs:   
MRI:  Periventricular white matter hyperintensities in left occipital lobe. 
Chest CT w/o contrast:  Calcified Granulomas in the posterior right upper lobe and liver.   
Vitamin D 1,25 68 (High)

Deficient response to Pneumonia vacine on 10 of 13 types. 
Albumin percentage borderline high (71) with high-normal absolute Albumin (5.4) 
Sed Rate:  5 
HIV:  Negative 

Unlikely based on additional labs: (MS, most autoimmune diseases) 

Questions: 
1)  What other diagnosis/tests would you recommend?  Lymphoma?  Fungal?  Which tests? 

2)  Can you read a calcified granuloma like active granulomas to determine the type of disease or do they lose their signifgance once calcified. 

3)  Is the TB skin test reliable? 

4)  I've read that high Vit D 1,25 is almost always signifigant, indicating either inflamation or extra-renal production of 1,25 from a granuloma activity.???  (Parathryroid function okay so that is not causing the problem with the excess 1,25 production) 

5)  Would a CT with contrast pick up active granulomas or is the CT I did w/o contrast sufficient? 



Thank you!

                Hi. My family and I have been going through a nightmare of testing. Our son has been limping for quite a few years-it seems to be exercise related. He seems to become fatigued and his left leg begins to weaken, causing him to limp. We took him to a orthopaedic specialist at our local children's hospital. The doctor ran a CBC with differential and suspects he may have a mild form of muscular dystrophy so performed a MDM as well (the results are not yet in). The CBC showed high Eosinophils, high Basophils, and low lymphocytes. We were told that it is likely allergy related and to follow up with the family doctor. We followed up with the doctor and a stool sample and abdominal x-ray were done. The stool sample was negative for parasites and the abdominal x-ray showed moderate stool-unremarkable were the remarks. 3 weeks after the initial CBC, the family doctor performed a repeat CBC and liver enzymes. The Eosiniophils were now even higher at 28%! Needless to say we are frustrated. His AST was mildly elevated at 47 (43 at the initial test). I've read that the AST is not always related to the liver but relates to the heart as well. His doctor mentions that he also has pre-hypertension but I don't get it because his blood pressure is generally always 95/64 or so but because he is being tested for Muscular Dystrophy and I know that heart conditions can be associated with Muscular Dystrophy, I am terrified that his AST is elevated and that his doctor says he has pre-hypertension. The Eosinophils are of particular concern. Can someone please please please help me with this? We are going to an immunologist tomorrow at our children's hospital but I want to be sure I'm not taking the wrong road. I am fearful something is wrong with his heart. Thanks

My concern is with the fluids I get in the area where the tumor was. I go to the hospital once a week to drain it.I know that during the surgery they cut a lymph node.

                An employee of mine went to the hospital last night with his 18 year old son with nose bleeds that they couldnt stop.
His wbc was very high and they think it might be Leukemia. Do any of these symtoms sound familier and if he does have it is there any cures or treatmants? By the way he is also a twin if that makes any difference.
Thank you for any information you can give me.

user_523927,ott70,/posts/Leukemia-and-Lymphoma-/CBC-counts/show/597188,CBC counts,"
                I've been having mystery symptoms for around 5 months now without much resolution other than something viral. I have been having some bruising lately (where blood was drawn, squeezing a couple of blackheads on my arm -- shame on me!) and some petechiae. The petechiae is sparse, so I have maybe 20 of them or so scattered across my body, mainly on my arms but some on the neck and chest. My primary doesn't seem too concerned about this.

I have had CBC counts pulled probably 4 or 5 times in the last 5 months. Nothing from my CBC counts suggest a blood disorder. Just some low lymphocytes that were almost back in range during my last CBC (2 weeks ago). 

So if I had something leukemic in my body are the multiple CBC's a good enough indicator to catch something like that or at least warrant further testing? I have not had my bone marrow tested since the doctors I have seen have not found any results in my bloodwork to suggest the need to.

I think that I have read that viral activity in a body can cause skin conditions, petechiae, and bruising. Is this logical? I have also had some swollen lymph nodes (I posted about this in a separate question on this forum) and various other body pains that have migrated around for the last few months. My spleen is slightly enlarged and my EBV titers are high (but the main titer for mono was in range). Once again, the CBC results did not flag my doctors.

Viral? Lyme disease?

                Hi, I am a caregiver for 20F with HD stage IIB having ABVD 2 cycles over. 
Started with extensive mediastinal lymphodenapathy and itching for almost 5 months before diagnosis. 
The WBC count started with 19000 and has been 5700-5000 (Neut - 50-58%) on each test 1 day before next chemo. HBG increased from 10.3 to 12 in the last test. 
Is this normal ? I understand the WBC is likely to drop further. Itching subsided completely, but recurred mild after 3rd dose and subsided again. 
Is the response positive? 
Since WBC stays normal at least when it is tested, is the risk of contracting infection as much as for a normal healthy individual? 
What steps can be taken to minimize Bleomycin long term effects - though I dont know much about the effects. 
Thanks for reading

                In someone with a lymphoma issue, would the lymph nodes generally keep growing bigger? I've always been told that lymphoma would result in a node that keeps getting bigger, like golf ball size, and not reduce back down again. I have some nodes that flare up once in awhile but they will settle back down after awhile. I think the biggest one has got is marble size, maybe like 1 cm or so. I also have one that seems to be hard to the touch sometimes but then other times it seems soft. I know that one has been felt by a few doctors without any reaction to it. This particular node is below my jawbone, so probably one of those submandibular nodes. I have also had big submandibular glands for years without any physician concern.

And, I have heard that touching your nodes a lot can cause the node to stay large.

                Hi Docs and all,

Just this morning I noticed lots of tiny red, pin sized dots on my right arm (just the arm not hand nor the upper arm).  I immediately think of Petechiae and I went to a dermatologist to confirm the diagnosis.  He said lots of tiny blood vessels burst underneath but didn't think it's blood disorder problem since it's only on my right arm and I don't have any other symptoms.  I also mentioned that I was bitten by insect on the same arm last night and that had some flu like symptoms last week.

I also have a little history of radiation.  Took 178 mci radioactive iodine to cure thyroid cancer last year.  I know that anything over 200 mci can increase the chance of blood disorder so I'm just worried whether this is blood disorder or simply irritation caused by the insect bite.

My doc told me to wait and see if it spreads. If it does, then do a CBC.  I'm 20 and no other obvious symptoms except I guess tiredness.  No weight loss but weight gain.

Does this make sense?

                Hi everyone. I have a  10 year old nephew in the family who was diagnosed with Burketts about 5 months ago. He had a tumor in his abdomen. The surgery to remove and the Chemotherapy brought him into remission (although he was very very sick with the chemo and they almost had to stop treatment before his cancer went into remission.)After his last dose of chemo he was sent home and seemed to be doing better until 2 months later, when he suddenly began to vomit and have severe headaches. Tests showed that he had cancer cells in his spinal fluid. The doctors suspected that the cancer had come back, possibly to his brain. Fortunately my nephew's scans showed no tumors. Still, they gave him only a 20% chance of beating the cancer. The treatment plan was to do the chemotherapy again, and once the cancer cells were gone, they would do a stem cell treatment (im not sure how that works). Well,after second round, scans etc show no cancer cells in his system. They gave him his last dose of chemo a couple of days ago with stem cell treatment planned for August 29. The last dose of chemo sent him into a coma. Although the doctors know which medication my nephew had the reaction from its pretty much a waiting game for the medicine to clear out of his system.My nephew is breathing on his own, athough they are helping him to assure he is getting adequate oxygen. He also is responding to commands and can squeeze his mothers hand and lift his leg. The doctors say they believe he will probably come out of the coma but arent saying 100% positive. Does anyone here have experience with recurring Non Hodgkins, Burketts, or has someone ever heard of this sort of reaction to chemo meds? Also, please pray for my nephew. His name is Mason. Thanks to all

                Hi, I'd like to start out by saying im a 21 year old male, and other then what has been going on recently I've always been healthy. 

Last August I first discovered a swollen node underneath my left ear. I was given an anti-biotic but nothing happened to the node. I was schedule for blood testing, and a ct-scan. Blood testing came back normal, but my ct-scan showed a nodule over 2 cm with other enlargements in my neck. I was scheduled to see a general surgeon to perform a biopsy. When I went and saw the surgeon he said he wasn't going to perform the biopsy, because the nodule wasn't "" that big "" in his opinion. He turned out to be right about three weeks later after six months the nodule went away. 

However, about a week after it went down I noticed two new nodules one on each side of my neck almost in identical places on each side. These nodules are still there and have been there for five months now. I've been terrified of lymphoma but I don't show any symptoms. No night sweats, fatigue, loss of appetite, or weight loss. Matter of fact I've gained 20 lbs since I first found these two nodules. 

I also am scared about whats going on in my mouth. I have two symettrical bumps on my upper gums along the palate line I suppose, that are underneath the gums not sticking out, you can only feel them. I also keep getting one or two white spots on my right tonsil only, and my throat looks like it can be pretty red sometimes. I'd like to point out that I'm not a smoker, and I rarely have a drink. 

I don't have any sore throat though thats the problem. It doesn't hurt to talk, or swallow. Everything is pretty much just there, but im not actually feeling any ill effects of whats happening. 

I was able to see an ENT and he said, he believed this was ""reactive lymph nodes "" due to infectious mono that I had three years ago. He said that mono never leaves the body and only becomes dormant until it becomes active again. However, he didnt give me a mono-spot test to verify, that's all he said. 

I really hope he's right, but I'm still really worried. If you go back to the first lymph node that eventually went away after 6 months, I've had nodule problems in my neck for 11 months now. Two rounds of anti-biotics haven't cleared anything. I know that I've listed alot of things here, but thats whats happening to me for almost a year now. I know lymph nodes that dont go away can be a bad sign. 

Any ideas?

                Hi,

I had a routine physical in May.  Everything was normal except a low WBC  (228 where over 400 is normal)...however the percentages/breakdown of the WBCs was all normal.  I was retested in July and it was still a little low 227, still all percentages were perfect.  RBCs were just a tad low, platelets fine, hemoglobin, hemocrit all fine.  My family doctor referred me to a hematologist.  He did another blood test exactly 1 week later and my   WBC was back to normal...around 500.  The nurse said 400 to 1100 is normal...not sure what units they are using.  He still put me on an iron supplement b/c he said he has seen menstruation affect blood counts.  I have absolutely no symptoms of anything...I feel perfectly fine. 

My concern is (1) is 7 days a short period for WBCs to go from 227 to 500?  Is that a rapid increase for a week? I did figure out that both times it tested low it was the week after my period.

(2)  I've not seen anything on the internet about iron increasing WBCs.  I can't figure out his reasoning for the iron supplement.  In my latest blood test, even my iron levels were fine. Have you ever heard of taking iron to increase WBC count?

He seems confident that I am perfectly healthy...but, I'm such a worry-wart that I keep searching on the internet for some dreadful disease that he may not have discovered yet. It doesn't help that a very good friend of mine died at my age (mid-30s) of leukemia.

*MRI and CT scan on head and neck, showed two lymphnode masses over 2 cm.  Went to ENT who wanted to watch for several weeks after antibiotic, said I needed adenoids removed and biopsied and possibly the node of my neck if it didnt go down. I finished five weeks of antibiotic and no change. I see him again on Wednesday.
*Nuerologoist thinks I had hemaplegic migraines causing weakness and tingling.  
*Had an echocardiogram that show hole in heart, have not seen a cardiologist yet to discuss this
*I also had pressure and swelling under left arm pit and at left elbow, however doctors did not acknowledge those symptoms, also behind left knee.  It didnt really cause pain, just pressure.
It has gradually gotten worse over the past month, now the swelling has spread from under my armpit around my left chest, parts of my left breast,  and up towards and under my collar bone. It feels swollen and several tiny lumps are palpable, however none are distinct like the one in my neck.  It is causing some discomfort in my chest near my shoulder when breathing, and feels like something is cutting off pressure in my left arm. Also very uncomfortable any way I sleep.    I went to gyno for yearly checkup and mentioned it to her and she immediately asked who was seeing me for it, and said it felt very abnormal. she is scheduling a mammaogram and ultrasound of breast and chest.  She said she isnt sure if it was breast or lymph related or both. 
Is this a sign of lymphoma even without ""large"" nodes? Is this something that should probably be mentioned to be biospied as well??? Any information would be appreciated

user_553200,Dek07,/posts/Leukemia-and-Lymphoma-/HepC-and-NHLNon-Hodgkins-Lymphoma/show/569573,HepC and NHL(Non Hodgkins Lymphoma),"
                Hi, I'm new to this site 

I would appreciate any information about marginal zone lymphoma (MZL) secondary to HepC infection? 
My partner was diagnosed with MZL in Jan 08 by surgical biopsy of a lymph node in his neck. It's a rare indolent form & most likely results from HepC infection. He has a small patch in the bone but CT scans & a PET scan revealed no other nodes in between, so is sort of stage 1 & 4 at the same time. 

He is 56yrs old, geno 1b, +ive for over 30 yrs.
The obvious tx is to treat the HepC, which his haematologist agrees with, but unfortunately he relapsed 6mths after 12mths tx on Pegasys in 2005. He has F4 cirrhosis, confirmed by biopsy pre-tx. His main issue with tx was thrombocytopenia which led his Gastro to dose reduce both interferon & ribavirin. He was however UND at 12 wks & remained UND at his 3mth PCR test, so contrary to what his gastro says, I believe he DID tolerate tx OK.
Towards the completion of his tx, his AFP suddenly spiked to 90 & a CT scan revealed a small hepatoma, which was successfully removed by a liver resection in June 2006. He has had no further tumours & his AFP now sits at around 15. The only other remarkable blood issue at the moment is thrombocytopenia (stable at about 85). He has splenomegaly.

The lymph nodes in his neck have flared twice since diagnosis. He has been referred to a radiation oncologist who will treat if it flares again. However, I understand it is best to not treat this indolent form unless absolutely necessary. He is also to have a test for cryoglobulins, which would be another diagnostic tool to link the MZL with HepC.

He will see his gastro later this month. We are desperately looking for a chance at re-treatment for the HepC, but anticipating some resistance. Even a maintenance type trial which would reduce viral load would be beneficial, since his Haem thinks the lymphoma may be triggered by an increase in viral load, which of course fluctuates.
I would greatly appreciate any info or suggestions regarding my partner’s situation.

Cheers
Dek07

user_230133,swee2000,/posts/Leukemia-and-Lymphoma-/Generalized-rash-since-starting-Fludara/show/476435,Generalized rash since starting Fludara...,"
                My husband began Fludara chemo treatments on 2/4/08. Since then, he's developed a generalized, constant, & extremely itchy rash all over his body. Initially, the rash started on his back, spread to his front torso around the time of the 2nd treatment, and, just today, began appearing on both sides of his neck & upper-half of his legs. The itchiness is so bad it leaves my husband scratching all day & all night, sometimes to the point of breaking skin &/or waking me up from a sound sleep due to how loud or vigorously he's scratching. Adding to the fact that my husband has CLL, thus the Fludara treatments, he's also a Type II diabetic, which adds to his body being more immune-compromised right now. 

The oncologist & his nurse practitioner are very aware of the rash, as both my husband & I have mentioned it to them. Yet, neither one has done anything to figure out what's causing it. They've both stated that it's not related to/caused by the shingles virus, mainly because the rash is so widespread & does not follow the typical nerve-root pathways. They've both suggested applying an OTC topical cream/ointment(like Hydrocortisone or topical Benadryl) to the rash &/or taking oral Benadryl, as well as making an appointment with a dermatologist. Well, my husband's done all of those, even tried the home-remedy of applying corn starch to his entire body. Yet, the rash continues to spread, the itchiness & scratching keep getting worse & more constant, the OTC treatments have not been effective, and my husband can't get an appt with the dermatologist for anytime in the next week(due to scheduling conflicts). Again, the oncologist is well aware of all of this, but still acts the least bit concerned about the rash, how long it's been going on, the fact that it's spreading, &/or that it's causing my husband so much discomfort(due to his never-ending need to scratch so much/bad).

Has anyone ever heard of Fludara causing an outbreak like this? Or could this be an allergic reaction to the drug? What else can my husband do if the doctor doesn't think the rash is med-related &/or something to be concerned about?

                I have CLL/SLL is it common to have a lot of bone pain throughout this disease? And the calcium pills that I am taking is not helping because I am getting to feel like a old lady when I walk up and down the stairs. Is there something else I should be taking. And when should I see my doctor or is it something I could solve by myself with exercise? Along with that I get chest pain, if there is fluid behind the chest cavity how can it be removed?

                I had a screening for Breast CA with MRI and it was negative, but they found mediastinal nodes. Then Helical Cat Scan which says Bilateral Apical Scarring, multiple prominent nodes within mediastinum--the largest with 18cm short axis measurement.  Prominence of right hilum worrisome for adenopathy measuring 2.4 X1.7 cm in size.   A precardinal node measuring 1.9 cm in short axis.

I have NO SYMPTOMS. What on earth could this be?  They found no cancer on the CAT, just the scarring.  After being on the internet I am afraid of metastatic cancer from somewhere(?), although I don't have any symptoms of anything.  A recent CBC was normal. I had a colonoscopy a couple of years ago--clean. My husband (RN) thinks it sounds more like scarodosis but I read that this is usually bilateral hilar enlargement.

i had posted this in lung cancer in error. The process is in the lymph system right now. Cat shows no lung nodules, effusions, etc... I know it still could be cancer but this seems to be the right place.

                My 76-year-old father has had elevated lymphocytes for over a year now, the latest being 5.0 (normal 0.7-3.5). His other tests are normal: platelet 183 (normal 150-400), WBC 9.7 (normal 4.0-11.0), monocytes 0.6 (ormal 0.0-1.0), eosinophils 0.2 (0.0-0.7), basophils 0.0 (normal 0.0-0.2), C-reactive protein 0.5 (normal 0.0-8.0) and spleen is normal.

He had been very tried lately.

He'll be going for flow cytometry and seeing a hemotologist but the appt isn't for a couple of months and I'm frantic that it's CLL. How concerned should I be?

                I had a cbc run after having a fever...extreme chills....sweats...etc for a few days.(this was the second time that it happened) I felt so completely drained after the episode I went to my doc. The doc looked at my face and said that there was something she was seeing (under my eyes and cheeks, which were red and dry) and she ordered a cbc. The results came back with low Serum Calcium (8.4) low white blood cell count (3.0) low platelets (126) High EOS (15) low neutrophils (1.2). I also had my blood checked in Nov.(6 months ago) by my gyno doc 
but I only had low calcium & WBC at that time and  he said he wasn't concerned by the numbers. However....now I am scheduled to see a hemotologist and also the cancer treatment center has called me to make an appt. to see them also. My doc is not giving me any idea what could be going on, just telling me to do my follows up with these other docs. I've been feeling tired for some time now. I also get alot of major headaches recently and alot of muscle cramps after just alittle bit of work. My right hand and right foot also become numb off and on all day long. I'm obese and have a 7 yr old (I'm 46) so I dismissed all of these symptoms as being my old fat self trying to keep up with my very active son....but maybe it is something else?? I was also checked for std's but all that was negative and my cholesterol levels couldn't get any better. I'm very concerned because I do have a young son to look after and I'm kind of on my own and if something could truly be wrong I have alot of things I need to get in order....just incase. If anyone knows what these results may mean I would be greatly appreciated with any info that u can share before I can get in to see the docs for my follow ups. I've been a nervous wreck waiting for my appts. Thanks in advance for all comments......LISA

                A few weeks ago, I was awakened from bad headaches for a couple of days in a row. I normally don't run off to the Dr, but I also noticed an area on the right side of my neck was extremely sore.  I went to my GP, who checked me for ear, or throat infection..which there was no sign.  I didn't feel bad otherwise. He said the lymph was a little swollen. He ordered CBC and gave me a Zpak of antibiotics. I took them immediatly, and left town for vacation.  I received a call from the nurse on my voicemail advising that my white count was elevated and the Dr. wanted me to return to retest. I did that the following week. I then received a call from the Dr. himself wanting me to come in the next day.  I did that. He showed me my charts.  The first blood test showed a white count of 18.0, and the second 16.3. He was concerned because the white count did not drop much after the Zpak. He began asking me if I had any other symptoms, such as night sweats...which I advised that I do.. Its not every night, and sometimes not even every week,but sometimes it's like I just ran a marathon.. I am drenched. Especially my neck and chest. I also have severe itching on my arms..and have for a year or so.  He referred me to an oncologist. I am going in this week for a series of tests, such as CT scan of chest, abdomin, and pelvis.  A urinalisis, and a blood test  (leukocytes?).   The orders said (R/O Hodgkins).   Another thing is that the last time I was at the Dr. for a physical (a year ago) my white count was 15.6. He had me return in 2 weeks and it dropped to 11.7. He figured I had some sort of infection that was clearing up on its own.  So the last 4 CBC's I've had show white counts from 11.7 to 18.0.   Could this just be some infection that hangs on? I have also had a cough that never goes away.  It is worse in the mornings.   (I am no longer a smoker)
I appreciate any insight anyone can give.

user_559714,mamameg827,/posts/Leukemia-and-Lymphoma-/Worried-about-my-two-year-old/show/568632,Worried about my two year old.,"
                Well, about 1 month ago we took our two year old daughter in for her annual well child check up. Basically everything looked good and she was healthy but there was a ""lump"" on the left side of her neck, sort of mid way between the mandibular angle and the ear. It was quite hard and not mobile. The doctor reasoned this was a lymph node and most likely related to a recent cold our daughter had as well as her trying to cut her two year molars. We scheduled a follow up appointment for a month later to check the status of this node, the doctor assumed it would have gone down. We just took her to the follow up appointment and while the lump is not quite as large as it was it is still hard as a rock and immobile. This seemed to raise a flag to the doctor. She said it was most likely nothing but she was concerned about lymphoma. We have a cervical CT with contrast scheduled in a few days but I am worried sick. The lump is not even the size of a pea, it is painless, and there are no other symptoms of any kind. She seems to be a healthy 2 year old with the exception of the lump. What could this lump be? How likely is it to be something serious such as lymphoma vs a calcification or infectious process? Any help or information would be so helpful and very much appreciated.

                I've been seeing my General Practitioner for the past 10 months and my bloods have shown on 4 separate occasions that my WCC is slightly raised and my white cell differential shows lymphocytosis. I am feeling pretty unwell and have recently become increasingly unwell. I suffer with excessive sweating and night sweats, slightly raised temperature, severe itching, abdominal swelling and other gastric and bowel symptoms, unrelenting tiredness and have suddenly developed  a golf ball sized swelling just above the cubital fossa region of my left arm. My doctor has suggested that the raised WCC and lymphocytosis are probably due to infection and not to worry about them. I have recently become prone to picking up coughs and colds, URTIs, UTI's and various other minor infections but the symptoms do evenually resolve. If it wasn't for the fact that I feel so unwell I wouldn't worry about the results. Is it possible to have a persistant infection lasting 10 months and could my results and symptoms suggest anything else? My liver and kidney fuction are ok, no evidence of mononucleosis, thyroid is normal, no anaemia, ESR normal. I'm desperate to get to the bottom of my symptoms.

user_555864,Messi,/posts/Leukemia-and-Lymphoma-/Swollen-neck-nodes/show/565708,Swollen neck nodes,"
                Alright, so, I've had a swolen lymph node both on the right and left sides of my neck for quite some time now, upwards of 1 1/2 years for sure. I read on a web site that constantly palpating them will keep them reactive and they will not return to their normal size, and since I do have a habit of doing this (like every 3 minutes!) I'm thinking that what happened is that I got some sort of infection, and the lymph node(s) swelled, and I noticed them when they were swollen, started playing with them (moving them around underneath my skin), and since then they have stayed the same enlarged size because of this. Now, I'm not sure if they are really swollen, they definetely are under an inch, I'd say less then a half an inch, but I can't find lymph nodes in those same places on other peoples necks when I try to, so I assumed their swolen. I haven't been sick for over a year now, not a fever, not the flu, not even a cold, so although I'm paranoid about it, I don't think I have lymphoma. Yesterday, when I read that palpating the nodes can keep them swollen, I decided to stop touching them, and I hope that it will go away within 4-6 weeks, and if not, I plan to visit a doctor. However, do you think that my current situation, with a seemingly obvious reason for the swelling and no other symptoms, warrants an immediate doctor visit?

Thanks

He relapsed after 12mths tx with Pegasys over 2 years ago. He has cirrhosis & has had a liver resection for a hepatoma post tx in 2006. Main issues of concern with bloods ATM are raised LFT's & thrombocytopenia.

Hi there. 

Increase in LDH level is a sign of a proliferative disease, meaning that cells in the body (mostly the blood cells) are undergoing proliferation and rapid turn over.  These can be seen in cases of blood malignancies like leukemia, and solid tumors such as lymphoma.  I suggest that you have the lymph nodes evaluated and possibly undergo a biopsy procedure to rule out these conditions.  If ever diagnosed with lymphoma or leukemia, chemotherapy may be warranted.  Lymphoma and leukemia are curable childhood diseases. 

Regards.

Thank you so much for your response... I have a question for you... Is it possible for my child to have a completly normal Blood count but still have lymphoma or Leukemia? The infectious diseases consultant says with my sons full blood count being so normal & the boood film not showing any abnormal cells.. means there is no way he could have it ?? Please could you comment on this?? 
He also feels the level of LDH being 896 is not too bad as the lab said anything up to 920 is normal (however in other labs they say only up to 490 is normal?) 

I was also lookin again at his test results.... His CH 100 total Compliment level was very raised at 1200 - but compents C3 & C4 were normal?? 
His IGE is massivly raised at 600 (normal should be under 32) 
His Albumin levels are slighty raised too. 

I really hope you can answer these questions for me.. Thanks again

                I was recently diagnosed w/type 1 diabetes, last November.  In May, one of my lymph nodes on the (L)side of my neck grew to the size of a golfball.  The node was resected and the final diagnosis was Kikuchi Disease.  At the same time, I was given Augmentin before the node was removed and I had an extreme reaction to the augmentin.  I have blistered and peeled my entire body 3times, my feet and toes are on their 5time, and feel like they will continue to blister and peel again.  I have been being treated by an ENT and Dermatology.  After 8weeks, my skin still hurts and itches.  
My dermatologist determined that the rash I have been experiencing is related to the augmentin.  Kikuchi can also have a rash.  I have had multiple blood draws during the last 2 months.  Even though my WBC's are w/in normal limits, my lymphocytes remain high.  My dermatologist going through my medical records noted that my lymphocytes were high before I got sick w/Kikuchi.  
I have now seen a Hematologist, who did a complete Leukemia blood workup.  One of his nurses called me to state that my WBC;s were normal, but my lyphmocytes were 4900.  What does this mean?  My md has not called me back yet.  Any answers?

                I have two questions:

What is the size of a suspicious lymph node compared to a normal sized one?

I have been having a feeling of something stuck in my throat and it is sore. The other night I drank two beers and ate alot of food I also took a viagra before that the sore throat got worse and it felt like it was closing. My body started to hurt. I have no swollen lymph nodes on my body except on my inner thighs there are two one on each side. They are both the same size about 1/4 of an inch and soft and rubbery and moveable. No family history of lymphoma and no other symptoms. What could be causing the alcohol reaction? I never had that type of reaction to alcohol before. Should I be worried?

My left shoulder and arm started having strange pains and feeling abnormal, a day later my left node in my elbow started swelling and also behind my left knee.  I experienced extreme numbness below my left knee down to my foot, with tingling and odd sensations in my left foot and left hand as well, to the point I limped when I walked. The region where it felt like the nodes were swollen was very tight feeling on the skin and extremely itchy. The leg and arm were not painfull, just a very odd feeling.  I started having headaches and severe migraines everyday with vomiting, with ringing in both ears, muffled sounds and thumping in my left ear, and a few days later I felt tightness and pressure on left side of my neck. I have been extremely tired and dizzy off and on. Sinuses infections almost every week since January, very pale skin, and easy bruising. I havent lost any weight, but do have slight night sweats.

I went to my PCP who sent me to an infection specialist two days later. I went to him and he called my PCP to have me admitted to the hospital to run ""testing"".  I spent 6 days of random testing starting on May 27.  I had x-rays of chest, left arm.  MRI of head and neck, ultrasound on vein on leg (to rule out blood clot), spinal tap to rule out menigitis, EKG, and tons of blood work -they used every single vein in my arms and hands, wich all collapsed and I was bruising all over for 3 weeks straight. My blood work just had elevated Sed Rate, elevated WBC of 13000, too much potassium. Im not sure about everything else, because the doctors really didnt discuss much with me. I saw a nuerologist who didnt think it was a neuro problem besides the migraines. The MRI showed bad sinusitis, mastioditis, and cerival lymphadenopahty with 2 nodes at least 2 cm, so they had me see an ENT dr. 

June 9, ENT dr had me do audio testing, which came out fine.  He did the scope down my nose and throat and said I had bad adenoid tissue build up, wich is rare for a 25 yr old since they are suppose to shrink when your a child still. He said he needs to remove them with surgery and will check for tumors, ect. He sent me to do a CT scan of head and neck to recheck lymph node sizes in my neck, ect. He put me on two weeks antibiotics, nasonex, and musanex.  I went back on June 23.  He reviewed results, adenoids still need to come out, acute sinusitis still showing on CT scan, and lymph nodes are still enlarged. He felt around on my neck, said they still feel about 1.5-2 cm.  He put me on two more weeks of antibiotic (a total of 5 weeks) and wants to see my on July 23 in which He will reaccess again and if they are still enlarged (which he thinks they probably will be) he is going to do double surgery, open biopsy on my neck lymph node and adenoid removal.  They arnt sure if this is what was causing all the other left side of body symptoms. 
My questions is...has any one had anything like this????  Couldnt these things be signs of something else?  What can I expect with the surgeries????? I am worried!

                Hi, My father has a family history of Leukemia (his father). Recently (this last year) he has experienced weight loss, fatigue, muscle/joint pain and most recently he had a total knee replacement surgery. The surgery seemed to go well until he has a prolonged moment of confusion, muscle spasm at surgical site and thus we took him to the ER.  An EKG and Echocardio-gram was performed - negative. A CT scan of his brain showed some area of concern, His blood pressure was elevated 213/17??? an MRI was preformed the following day showing multiple strokes in both lef and right reions of the optic quadrants. An eye exam has shown 80% vission loss in one eye and 40% in the other. Blood tests have shown an ESR = 27 and a CRP-12. A biopsy of the temporal aerteries was performed , the report reads = negative.
His current medications:
Flexerall, Traumedall, Toperill, 81mg bayer aspirin.
Does anyone have any recommendations on what type of doctor/specialist we shoud see and what are some of the possibilities of what we are looking for?

                Hi - My mom was recently diagnosed with very high blood pressure - 210/140 - she never has had BP before, healthy heart 57 year old asian non smoker non alcoholic vegetarian woman. When the doc did her blood work, the found the following: 

wbc leuko - 4500

eosino - 4%
lympho - 55% = 2475
mono - 5%

the doc is not saying anything right now and only asked her to relax - but I am worried sick. I would like to find out what the caused of this bloodcount could be, and what is the probability that this could be some form of leukemia? How serious could it be given these values?

                I am 50 y/o female, an ex-smoker of 25 yrs., I stopped smoking in 2000. I was dx'd  with Pulmonary Sarcoid (per biopsy)and Asthma in 2002 and treated with Prednisone and Advair Diskus.  Prednisone stated at 30 mg daily and tapered off after 8 months and continued with the Asthma treatment since.  February of this year, symptoms of Sarcois re-appeared (major SOB) and prednisone was prescribed at 60mg daily.  Hospitalized 4/8-4/11 w/pneumonia, released w/ rx for Levaquin 500mg daily, albuterol/neb 4 x daily. Pred has been tapered to 20mg daily.  I still experience SOB, but one of my main concerns is pain in my armpits,and the rib area beneath and between the breast areas and in the general lung area. I have mentioned the pain to my pulmonary doc and he has advised that tenderness is to be expected.....what I experience is beyond tenderness, it's painful.  I have had CT's and a mammogram done to be on the safe side and all result returned normal (considering the Sarcoid).

Is the pain I mention above typical w/Sarcoid?

Thank you for your time and consideration.

                Hi, I am a 22 year old male. I have had swollen lymph nodes for about 2 months, 3 in my neck(one under my jaw, one under my left ear, and one in the back of my neck by the hair line), 1 under my armpit, and two in my groin one on either side. I had a couple CBCs done by an ENT and had a low white blood cell count (around 3.4). I was referred to a hematologist who looked me over, checked by hand for a swollen spleen, and did some more blood tests(a blood chemistry, another CBC, and a couple others that I don't know about). I was put on an antibiotic to try to get the swelling down, can't remember the name. I'm not showing any other symptoms except some abdominal discomfort. The CBC I had done showed my WBC going back up, and a second done a week later was showing a normal count of around 5.5. The other blood tests he said came back fine. The lymph node under my ear has gone away completely, but the others still persist. He told me that I had probly gotten a random virus and that is what had caused my lymph nodes to swell. It has been three weeks since my last visit and the swollen lymph nodes still persist and haven't really shown any sign of getting smaller. Is it common for swollen nodes to decrease in size one node at a time? How long should it take swollen lymph nodes to go back to normal and should I be worried about lymphoma still? Should I get a second opinion?

                I'm worried sick about my mom.  Let me start off by saying that her wbc has been really low for years. Probably more than ten.  They have done numerous tests and have found nothing.  They have chalked it up to a chronic low white count.  Less than a year ago her platelet count showed up low.  They re tested a week later because she had been sick and it went up a little so they said with her history they would just watch her.  Around that same time she had pain in her groin area and thought she had a hernia or a pulled muscle.  She just now went to the doctor for it and turns out its her lymphnodes that are swollen.  She has about five in her groin area on the same side swollen.  They are painful and uncomfortable.  Tommorrow they are taking out the largest one and sending it for a biopsy.  I'm a nervous wreck.  I'm 31 but not prepared to loose my mom just yet.  We have no history in our family anywhere of cancer and she has no other symptoms at all.  I am usually on the maternal board and this is my first visit to this one.  If anyone could give me some insight (good or bad) I would appreciate it.

                My 7 year old daughter discovered a hard bump on the back of her head (occipital bone I think) and after a week we went to the doctor with this bump still there and a line of posterior cervical nodes that are enlarged.  She is average to petite in size and you can see the node enlargement with your naked eye.  The node closest to the boney feeling bump is smaller than the nodes slightly lower than it.  She's been on Augmentin for a week and the nodes and the bump are still there with no change in size.  The nodes are not tender at all to palpate.  She has not recently been sick.  I have pulled a few dog ticks off of her scalp in the past few weeks but they couldn't have been there too long since we live in the country and we check heads all the time for ticks at this time of year. She has also been recommended for a tonsilectomy and adnoidectomy due to a number of strep and sinus infections.  However from what I understand this would not effect the posterior cervical nodes.  Otherwise she appears healthy.  She is going for a CT scan tomorrow.  The nodes are maybe 1.5cm in size.  Does this sound as worrisome as I keep reading it could be?

                I have had several symptoms that point to lymphoma for the past three to four years. My wbc has been low for the past three to four years as well. It ranges between 2.8 to 4.0. Usually stays around 3.5. I have also had night sweats for the last 3 years. It has been more frequent lately. I had a bone marrow biopsy in October of last year and it came back all clear. I also had my chest xray come back clear. I don't know what to think. I have also been VERY tired since last October. I was diagnosed with chronic EBV and my titers are extremely high, like in the 3,000 range. So that could be the explanation for all of this but still in the back of my mind I am concerned about lymphoma. Would my wbc be on the higher side if I had lymphoma? I don't know what to think. Any opinions? Thanks.

                Hi....My name is Teresa and i'm a 34 yr young mum from the UK who is desperate for some advice on what may be wrong with me. My journey began way back in June 2007 when i found a small, hard, pea size lump behind my right ear. My dentist advised me to consult my GP which i did in august. She gave me an examination and informed me that i also had some swelling in the right side of my groin and after a few weeks of her ruling out the norm, i was referred to haematology. Because i'd lost weight and was getting increasingly tired, they decided to admit me on the 6th nov,  for tests which included a CT scan and inguinal node biopsy. CT scan showed normal and biopsy of node showed reactive. Since then i have developed enlarged nodes in both sides of neck, under both armpits, both sides of groin, behind knees and what feels like small rubbery lumps between my ribs on my chest wall. I went to haem last week who questioned my eating habbits because i had lost more weight and i basically felt like an anorexic lunatic!!!!! He wouldn't even listen 2 my other symptoms which are......increasing frequency of night sweats, burning itching mainly on my arms, extreme fatigue tho i am now mildly anemic, pins and needles in the left hand and foot also eye twitch on that side, hair loss and a pinprick blood rash that is developing on my legs and abdomen, which appears to be under the skin. He did mention that my left inguinal nodes are quite large ( x3 about the size of 1/2 my little finger ) and that maybe i should have another biopsy done. Thing is, i learned that these nodes are very poor for obtaining a diagnosis and am worried that these nodes will only show reactive again, however all my other nodes seem to grow to about 1cm and then stop but thats when a new one appears. Also where i had my last biopsy done, the node there is rock hard, is this normal after 4 months???? Things just don't feel right, as a person you know your own body and something is wrong but i feel i'm having 2 fight for answers.

I will only give the flagged ones: 
WBC 13.8   Range 3.8 - 12 K/CUMM
HCT  46.3   Range 32.9-45.4 %
MCV  97     Range 74-96 CUMI

I have been tested for all sorts of diseases, mono, cat-scratch fever, lupus, MS, RA and all normal except my lymph nodes. 

I have been having painful swollen lymph nodes under the jaw line for the past two months.  I have been on prednisone hoping it would help, but it did nothing for me. They are still trying to figure out what is wrong with me for the last two years. My regular doctor told me i had to go see an ENT regarding my  lymph nodes. My symptoms are weight loss, night sweats, deep bone ache (i think it is the bone, could be muscles) in both my thighs. Frequent urination, insomnia. They did find a 2"" mass in my pelvis, but will re scan in 2 months. I have had a thyroidectomy about 14 yrs ago, but they assure me it is not causing my problems. 

Is this something to worry about? I had these done back on 5/2, but could not get in to see ENT until end of June.

Thanks in advance. I unfortuanely am a smoker, i smoke about 5-10 cigs a day. I know i should quit

                  I am wondering if A cat scan would show any signs of lymphoma.  I just had one done on May 21 for abdominal pains.  I have had many blood tests done and all of my CBC counts came back ok except for my thyroid ( have hashimotos thyroiditis) and liver enzyme was elevated.  I had hepatitius panel and that was ruled out.  Ultra sound showed some fatty liver.  My gastro doctor wants me to go to a hemotologist to have lymphoma ruled out.  the mere fact that he suggested that scares me.  So my question to you is.....If I had lymphoma,  would it show up in a CBC blood test?  I have been complaining of abdomial pains since November of 07 and they just now did the Cat scan of my abdomen and pelvis, colonoscopy ( which showed inflammation of small intestine and colon), and an endoscopy.
  I feel weak all the time and am worried about lymphoma.  I will be going to hemotologist soon.

I went and had the ultra sound done and it founfd a 1 cm noudle/lump on the left side of thyroid. So a thyroid scan was ordered. The scan came back normal and the lump was not seen.

Today I go to thr Dr. so they can explain my results and they say that it is nothing wrong or on my thyroid and thay it is prob. an enlarged lymphnode. It feels very large to the touch. Now the Dr. has orderd a CT scan. What could this be. It has been there for at lest 6 mo. I am always tired, I even get tired from getting dressed.

My doctor has told me that I have had no miricle remission in my blood work that at the moment there is no protein in my kidneys and as yet my bones have no lesion areas. I do have an appointment in a couple of days to see the results of my biopsy. I feel he thinks I have it but just not sure what stage. Am I jumping to conclusions that aren' t there or are they justified? Can you shed some light on this as it is driving me crazy. Just what chance do I have of having MM?
With Thanks

                Thanks for reading.

     I am a 25 year old male about 100 pounds overweight. I have recently been diagnosed with gynecomastia and am awaiting a blood test for hormones. Anyway one of my fears was maybe it was caused by a testicular tumor so I have been doing exams and no lumps. Above my left testicle there is some veins and what feels like a cyst soft and probably fluid filled. Sometimes I have pain-ache in groin or legs lately seems to be less though. Sometimes I have erection problems. I have fat legs that feel lumpy or fatty, but when I really put pressure and rub I can feel a lump on the right side of my inner thigh. Both thighs have a lump in the same area, but the one on the right side is slightly bigger. I have no other signs sometimes I get itchy, but from what I have heard to be a symptom the itching would probably be intense. The lump is soft, moveable, and a little tender. 

I am wondering also what are the characteristics of the lumps in lymphoma
Size?
Location?
Moveable?
Tender?

Are they harder to detect in overweight people?

I see my doctor next week so I am just looking for some opinnions until then.

Thank you

                I have a round dark blue mark on the outside of my arm, just above my elbow. This mark is certainly not caused by bumping into something or anything like that. I've been getting this dark blue mark every other two weeks on exactly the same spot. I had a bigger dark blue mark on the inside of my leg just below my knee as well, just noticed it out of the blue. And also my nose seems to be bleeding quite frequently (at least once a month) is this normal?

                I was diagnosed on Thursday with Lymphoma. The type was not told me to me. My primary doc told me after the results of my PET scan. I had a  chest CT scan on May 7th because of an undefined lump on my chest near my shoulder. The CT scan showed that all of my lymph nodes were enlarged in chest and under my arm. The radiologist stated that it was lymphoma or some type of metastasic disease. I had a biopsy of my lymph nodes from under my arm and my doc told me that the preliminary results showed that I did not have lymphoma. Then she told me that she wanted me to have a PET scan and gave me a ""barney version of what this test would show. I did my own research and found that this test detects and stages cancer. I was having weird symptoms in my chest along with the undefined lump that was causing me discomfort and everyone was passing off as a pulled muscle.  My primary doc showed me the preliminary results of the PET scan but I did not see anything about staging. She should me the biospy results that were inconclusive. Can you still have cancer with inclusive biopsy and normal blood levels????

                My 18-year-old son has been very ill for several months.  He became suddenly ill last summer and has not been well one day since.  He has had fatigue, widespread pain, severe headaches, jaw pain, swelling under his chin, sharp stabbing pains throughout his body, burning and itching sensations of the skin.  After seeing several different doctors and specialists with no answers, we began to wonder if he had Lyme disease.  We went to see yet another specialist who ordered a whole new long list of lab tests.  His results showed some lab work that is very concerning.

His Epstein-Barr tests were all positive.  His interleukin-6 was elevated at 8.2.  He had elevated T-cells and B-cells, which the lab remakred could be indicative of Burkitt's lymphoma.  He also had an elevated TSH, elevated sed rate and elevated C-reactive protein.  He will be seeing an oncologist next week to further investigate this.

I am simply looking for some guidance here, or to talk with someone who is more familiar with lymphoma and the above tests to give me some insight.  Thank you.

                My three year old daughter has had swollen lymph nodes in her neck since Thanksgiving of last year.  They are very slowly getting larger and slowly spreading down her neck (it's on both sides, just behind ears down to collar bone).  She is always sick.  A cold, cough, fever that comes and goes (but is fairly mild most of the time), ear infection on occasion and the antibiotics never help.  She hasn't lost any weight, but she does sweat pretty bad at night (or any time she sleeps).  Sometimes she complains that her legs hurt, but I'm not sure if they really do or not.  The docs keep saying that it's allergies (no allergy meds help at all) and that ""Some kids are just lumpy.""  Three different doctors have said that ""It's too early to be worried about anything weird like lymphoma or anything"", yet since three docs have said that, I'm now worried that she could be seriously ill with mild symptoms.  Am I overly worried or should I nicely demand they test her for cancer???

                I am quite and intelligent women, some would even say I am very intelligent.  I can read and understand what I read.  I have had a career within the Inland Revenue although I no longer am in Employment this is because of ill health, not because I am incompetent.  This being so, why does a simple visit to my GP and Nurse have such an impact on me.

I have an enlarged Lymph node in my groin.  I know it is a Lymph node as 2 years ago I was due to have it removed at a hospital here in the UK.  The surgeon told me it was a Lymph node.   Just before I was due to have it removed my husband and myself moved from Preston to Leeds.  I then went to a new GP and told him the history, he then referred me to scan department to confirm it was infect a lymph node.  The results came back that it was indeed a Lymph node.  Having read up on the condition it was clear to me that it was more trouble than it was worth to have it removed, as complications from the operation could be worse than having the node in the first place.  I discussed this with my GP and we agreed that it maybe better to leave it at the present time, unless it changed.

Recently there have been changes in the presentation of the Lymph node and as previously discussed with the GP I thought I really should have it looked at again.  Unfortunately my Husband and I moved aging and so although we continue to live in Leeds we had to sign up with another GP.  So off I went to see my GP and told him what had taken place previously, his reply was alright come back in and see the nurse with me and we will then refer you to the surgeon.  Today I had that appointment; it was the nurse whom gave me the exam.  Her reply to the Doctor was, yes she has a Hernia.  I calmly tried to tell her that it is not a Hernia but a lymph node, she insists that it is a hernia and even tried to imply that a hernia and a lymph node are the same.  So the end result they are going to refer me to the surgeon with a Hernia when it is actually a Lymph Node.

Apart from the obvious, what worries me is that a Hernia may be painful but a hernia is just that a bulge of the bowel that is protruding through the Muscle.  Where as the Lymph node has changed, I have no presenting reason for the change, I have not recently had an infection, cat scratch or any chance it could be a NSTD or VD or HIV or any other common ailment.  This leaves me to deduce it could be just one of those things or something more sinister.  Whilst a Hernia is not an emergency, cancer could be.

I am truly sorry for this rant but I am feeling as though they think I am lying and they actually insult my intelligence.  I feel emotional and close to tears, but I think it frustration that the Medical Community at the local levels seem to think their patients are lying imbeciles

Any suggestions,

Thank you

                Hello,

My wife discovered that she has an enlarged lymph node under her jaw line. She felt it the first time while eating and i could also see it. It was pretty big. Within a couple of hours, it seems that it got smaller but she could still feel that it was bigger than the one on the other side. She went to the doctor who basically told her to wait another month and to come back in case it's still there. She had not infection or cold or whatever related symptoms. She got work done (crown) of 2 teeth on the same side though. She showed it to the dentist and it couldn't find any infection. For a while it was back to small but now, every now and then when she eats, it pops out big.... She says it's not painful but annoying. One morning she freak out because her mouth and hand got numb for a few minutes.


I was wondering if the fact the swelling comes and go means that it moves or that it actually swell? 

She is going back to the doctor in a week or so but i am concerned that it could be serious.

What is my onc likely to use next, and will it be harder than fludarabine?? My GP phoned me yesterday to tell me that my neutrophil count was very low. I know this can be a sign of leukemia  because the bone marrow produces immature white cells in this disease, which leaves less room for mature white cells in the blood. I also know that neutropenia can have other causes. I haven't had chemo for a year. Is it possible that chemo is responsible for my nertropenia?

                My grandmother has been living with CLL for over 10 years. She recently progressed to a new level of chemotherapy in the form of pills, and although I'm not sure what type they are, I know that they're steroids. She's been living quite well with it, but had been throwing up for some time (voluntarily), and occasionally complaining of stomach pains that she said would go away with chamomile tea (though looking back, I'm sure she was just saying these things to prevent all of us from worrying).

Anyway, my grandmother had emergency surgery on Wednesday because she was complaining of severe abdominal cramps. A CT scan indicated that her bowel had ruptured, and she had to be operated on immediately. We were told she likely would not survive the surgery. She did.

We discovered that she had lymph nodes in her abdomen (perhaps from a previous bout of cancer she had about 15 years ago), and an infection was spreading throughout her body. She's now on life support, and has suffered from septic shock, with her kidneys failing, and her liver beginning to fail. In two days, her kidney began regaining some function, her vitals are somewhat stable (occasionally requiring assistance for a few hours), and her liver does not seem to be in grave danger at the moment. She is also very cognitively aware, but she cannot say anything (though she wants to) because she has a tube down her throat, and is very agitated that it's there.

We have just been told that her medication to treat the CLL is counteracting with the antibiotics being given to her intravenously, and are thus compromising any attempts to get her to recover. I was wondering if this is indeed true, what her likelihood for survival and/or recovery is (if that information is known at all), and is septic shock/ruptured bowel is a complication of CLL or if it is a completely unrelated matter.

Thank you kindly. It's been a trying time.

                Year ago I was diagnosed with NHL. Symptoms: enlarged groin lymph glands, severe pruritus (generalized, scalp worse), tinnitus, flu symptoms AM, and night sweats. Biopsy confirmed the diagnosis. I underwent a course of six chemo treatments (vincritine, drug X, prednisone) over 18 weeks. After the first treatment, all symptoms remitted, except the lymph gland enlargement, which cleared more progressively until gone. Two weeks after completing the last treatment, the pruritus and other symptoms resumed, but were less severe, and without the night sweats. I was started back on prednisone, 20 mgs daily plus clobetasol foam (another steroid) intermittently. That was six months ago. The oncologist was skeptical of active NHL return and referred me to two dermatologists, but neither of them did any diagnostics to find out the underlying cause. Pruritus and other symptoms continue at the same level today. 

Does this circumstance sound familiar to any one. Thanks.

For many months i've noticed some irritation there, beginning after I shaved my armpits once. I just thought it was some reaction from that, but now finding that lump there, im concerned. Im not sure if it's a swollen lymph node, or a cyst, or something else entirely. I've scheduled a doctors appointment, but hope to find some kind of understanding prior. I've read that swollen lymph nodes can be an early sign of hiv infection, and last year there were two instances that would put me at risk with partners of unknown status. I plan to get tested soon, but in the meantime I'm hoping to understand this better as well. I only have the one lump, and hiv is usually indicated by more then one? Also, my hand on the arm with the lump, that hand frequently gets impetigo ever since I was a child. Im not sure what kind of impetigo, though judging from descriptions and photos on the web, my best guess is bollus impetigo. Could this lead to a swollen lymph node there?

The show has three goals: 1: To spread awareness of diseases, illnesses, and disorders.  2. To educate people, not on just a scientific/biological doctor’s point of view, but from the view of the people that actually have the disease.  3. To promote giving to foundations.  We already have candidates with MS, CKD, fibromyalgia, arthritis, and more.
Should you chose to send us your story, make sure you include how and or when you acquired the illness, how your life was before, and how it affects your life now.  Even if you do not wish to be featured on television, it is of great help to us to know your story.  The more that we can learn from real people, and not doctors and books, the better we will be at putting a human face on disease. Thank you for your time, and we wish the best to all of you.

                Hi, 

My son will be three years old next month. Since he was the age of 11 months I have noticed a lump on the left side of his neck.  It appears to be a swollen lymph node and is mobile.  I have brought it to the attention of our family doctor, a walk-in clinic doctor and his pediatrician and they all have only ran a CBC (blood test) and shrugged it off.  His results of the test came back within normal range all three times.  The mass has not changed in size, but is still there.  His doctors don't seem concerned, but as a mom I am.  Last night I felt another swollen node in his groin area, again it is not fixed.  He is very active and seems perfectly healthy as he is gaining weight and devoloping as he should.  The only other concern I have which may or may not be related to the swollen glands is that he itches quite a bit, regardless of changing detergents, lotions, etc.  Any thoughts on what his condition may be and how can I convince these doctors to take our situation more seriously?

I have developed hardened, subcutaneous facial lumps (bilateral) along with the facial swelling from the meds.  There are two pair of lumps, both can be traced in a line from the middle point of my eyes down to my cheeks, and then again in in line down along the mandible at the corners of the mouth.   They are each about 1.5 inches in diameter.
Is this something I should be concerned about?  
I am aware that lymphoma is a side-effect of the meds that I am taking.

Thanks for your help.

                Thanks to everyone who replied to my earlier posting of this subject. 
Just for a recap:   My 3 yr old daughter was was admitted to the hospital and ""leading"" diagnosis was discitis in Novemeber after 4 weeks of fever and what we thought was the flu, she couldnt walk and was in A LOT of pain. MRI was normal and x-rays showed some narrowing of disk space, blood work relatively normal and sed rate was 74. It took her a good 6-8 weeks to walk normal again.
End of December, she started running fever again with some congestion/cough.  She ran fever off and on through January into Feb. Took her to the Dr. several times, they tried antibiotics but nothing helped her or even slacked the fever off.
Feb:  admitted to pediatric hospital again.  Her fever wouldnt drop below 104, complained of leg pains, cough.  They did x-rays, blood work only thing was elevated Sed rate (50) and abdominal series ultrasound which they found large sludge build up in gallbladder,  they referred us to infection specialist
She continued with fevers off an on through march.  Specialist just wanted to watch her and see if her blood counts flucuated or not over a six week period and if her fevers would continue.  They said they werent going to be alarmed until any new symptoms appeared or her blood work was way off. They told me if it came down to it they would do a bone marrow testing (which they havent done yet).

 Other symptoms beside fevers:   leg and back pains, sometimes arm pains, paleness, droopy eyes sometimes, tiredness, severe night sweats and she doesnt sleep through the night -she gets up crying several times, some of the fevers she had congestion and cough

The fact is my daughter is still sick,  she has recurring fevers every 4-7 days still and the fever stays another 5-7 days since December.  They have not given me a definite diagnosis.  This is April and the fevers have not slacked off.  Last thursday she came to me crying that her back and legs hurt. The next day she woke up with 103.4 fever, the fever stayed through the weekend and even with motrin it only went down to 101.  She did not have any congestion but had a constant cough.  I called her dr immediately monday morning and they sent me to do blood work and x-rays.    The results came back, the chest x-ray showed peribronchicial markings,  blood work was relatively normal:  Low side of white blood count (4), increased lymphocytes count 58%, slight increase sedrate and CRP count. They also said she tested slightly positive for mono this time., they said she probably just acquired that in the past week and it had nothing to do with the other months of sickness.  

I spoke with her specialist and I am waiting on a call back from them to let me know if they need to see us sooner than her May appointment date.  Im not sure if this classifes as the ""new symptom "" they were looking for to procede with further testing.
  
My question is....Im still very worried that this is something more serious like leukemia or lymphoma.  Any input or information would be appreciated!

                Hello all! I have been through it the last 2 yrs medically. A couple years ago I had a neck lymph node all swelled up, and there was no pain or infection. The docs couldn't figure it out, so just had me watch it. It has gone down in swelling, but time a time again with colds/sore throats it goes back up. Well, shortly after that first lymph node episode, I had severe upper left quadrant pain. That took forever to figure out, that it was my spleen, and it had enlarged quite a bit, and I had to have a splenectomy, and then found that I had several benign epithelial cysts inside of it-and another spleen, they removed everything. Well, since then, I have had even worse health problems, from blood in urine-with no infection like 3 times, chronic dry eye, one sided headaches, chronic colds, sore throats, and tonsilitis episodes, and swollen lymph nodes on my neck and back of head, and on jaw. Recently I just had my very first fever blister on my mouth that caused my jaw line lymph node, and neck to swell very large, even the ENT was impressed by them. However, because of the viral infection going on, he linked it to herpies. So that took a while to go back down, but not away. I also have waken up with severe one sided hip/pelvic pain, and it was hard to walk for several days, but got better, I have know idea what that was about. I also have had many muscle issues-with spasms, and tightness. Anyway-I'm a 29 yr old mother of one who is 10 now, and would like some information. thanks all!!

                I have been experiencing multiple symptoms for some time now. The first symptom i started experiencing started in late february of this year. Its difficult to describe. But it is simular to or can be a fever. My body started feeling hot. I haven't checked to see if i had a fever because i don't have a thermometer. I am not hot to the touch. The sensation becomes worse when my body is touching something. For example, if im lying down on my back, my back begins to start feeling really hot, the sensation as if someone is holding something hot against me. Yet when i touch my back it feels normal temperature. This happens to any part of my body that is touching something for an extended amount of time. If im standing i don't feel this way at all. Ive had this for 2 months now. It has not gotten better or worse. It has just stayed the same. A week after i developed this  had stomach discomfort. I felt this pressure, fullness type. Felt like i had an upset stomach. It went away after a week or so. 2 months later(now). I have the same feeling again. No pain, just feels like an upset stomach. Lately ive been experiencing this taste of blood in my mouth. At times when i spit in the sink my mucus comes out pinkish. Not most of the time, but sometimes. As well as blood laced in my snot when i blow my nose on the tissue. But ive also had a runny nose since this started.

I had my annual check up in early january of this year. Had blood drawn from me 3 times. All came out normal. Other than having an ""elevated white blood cell count"" the doctor said. He didn't seem concerned. But two weeks  before my appointment i had just gotten over a urinary tract infection. Could i have still had an elevated WBC from an infection i had almost 2 weeks before i had blood work? Those are symptoms i am experiencing. I have been really concerned of the possibility of cancer. As i know a stomach fullness can also be caused from an elarged spleen caused from leukemia. As well as the other unusual symptoms i have been experiencing. Any insight and opinions as to what may be going on would be great. 

I am 20 year old male. No family history of cancer.Only history our family has had is high blood pressure. Thank you for your time.

                I am trying to figure out what the cause of severe pain in arm/shoulder after just one swallow of any type of alcoholic beverage.  This started a year ago, and has become more severe and lasts longer as more time goes by.  It happens within a minute of one swallow of alcohol.  The pain comes, peaks, and fades away.  It is a painful ache type pain that radiates down my arm sometimes to my wrist, and at first it was only my right arm, but in the past month has began to include my left arm.  It so painful and nasty, that I feel like I have severe body aches at the same time in my chest, shoulder and arm area.  I have had one pathologist tell me it is a sign of hodgkin's disease, and another doctor say it could be a sign of gerd.  I have asked my gastroenterologist if he has ever had a patient complain of this or if he has heard of this and he hasn't.  I don't have any palpable enlarged lymph nodes that I can feel, but when the pain subsides after about 5 to 10 min after it starts, I don't have any feelings of heartburn.  I have read about the connection to HD, and wonder why it happens, and if maybe this is what is going on.  Any help would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks in advance

                Hello Doctor
I am a 42 year old male, father of 6, non smoker.  I have been having swollen non descript pain in my left neck area for about a year.  It started last spring with a bout of sub acute thyroiditis.  I was treated for that and it resolved itself by December 07.  I still have a full feeling under my ear and swollen lymph node about the size of a pea under my left ear.  The CT scan with contrast showed that all was well.  My blood test were all ok here in the states.  When I was in the UK from sept 07 to march 08 the doctor there tested my blood and found the viscosity was too high indicating something was possibly going on.  The doctor here put me on 21 day regimen of antibiotics and did another CT scan yesterday.  My question is... what is the next step?  Would my many blood tests have revealed anything sinister?

Kind Regards

                I have an enlarge lymph node in my leftside groin.  After the area was scanned my doctor said that the lymph node was indeed swollen, but because it was 2cm and borderline size, I could choose as to whether or not to have it removed.  After researching the matter I drew the conclusion that as it was the size it was, that it had not changed since finding it some 4 years ago and finally all the articles I read suggested that having it removed could pose more problems than keeping it,  I would not have it removed.

Now there seems to have been a change.  The lymph node is closer to the surface than it was, so therefore it feels some what larger,  I am experiencing a large amount of pain in the area and indeed all down my left leg, into my knee and ankle.  My leg seems slightly swollen and is also slightly lighter in colour.  I measured my leg and it is a full inch larger in circumfrence than my other leg.

I am also experiencing pain in my shoulder, just above the inside of my left elbow which also has a lump and deeper in my pelvis.  

I am now eating a healthier diet in a bid to reduce my weight I am eating 1200 to 1500 calories a day without ever going over that amount I weigh and track my food religiously.  I ensure my fat intake is on the low side my protien is at 25%  and the rest is carbs,  yet I am gaining roughly 2lb a week. I am 5foot 5in and currently weigh 338lb and lead a sedentary lifestyle at the moment.

My question is this,  could the lymph node have changed?  Is the swelling and colouration of the leg significant.  And is this also linked to my weight gain.

                Hi....23 y/o female. 
I have been reading alot about Follicular Lymphoma and I was just wondering if it commonly presents with something like I have. I know it is typically an ""older person"" disease, however it has occured in younger people.   I have a 2x2 ROCK hard  non-tender mass about 1 cm under the mastoid where the sternomastoid attaches.  My doctor felt it 6 months ago and said it felt like a trigger point.  I can feel it better when my neck muscle is relaxed and really have to push hard to feel it when it is contracted...so it appears to either be attached to the inside of the muscle or deep to it.  It does not move or give at all even if i push as hard as I can.  It has not grown in 6months...maybe a little but not much if it has.  I have no other symptoms besides occasionally (2-3x month) waking up sweating....not drenched like others have mentioned but pretty sweaty.  This seems to be correlated to bad dreams most of the time but 1 or 2 times with no cause at all.  Like I said this has only happened a few times so I am also wondering if the night sweats associated with cancer occur intermittantly like this or usually get progressively worse? Sorry for the long post, as you can see I am extremely concerned and all my doctor had to say was that it felt like a trigger point.  I do have a stiff neck alot but I am skeptical to think that it can cause such a rock hard nodule in my neck that wont go away.  Anyone else ever have a mass like this?  Any opinions/suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

                I have been seeing a neuro. for a couple months now. He has run every test thinkable and still I dont have answers. I began thinking maybe its a lymph node. I have severe pain in the back of my neck, behind my ear and in jaw area. All this began by me having 7 migraines in 8 weeks. The pain in the neck and ear would get so bad I would wind up with a migraine. I have been checked by ENT as well. MRI of neck, brain, and spine. The biggest complaints I have are the above mentioned neck, ear pain, sweats (not hot flashes really sweats that drench me), weakness on left side of body. I am on pain meds for the pain. Yesterday at my appt. he prescribed KEPPRA as a preventitive. Also, ATEX if I feel a migraine coming on. I have gained 25 pounds since Jan 23! I figured because my GP put me on predisone at the beginning of all this. But I am still gaining. No I am not as active, because my body does not allow me to be. My doc has ruled out MS. Most of my sx were pointing in that direction, but all tests came back good.
I have swelling in my left side of neck, under arms, and groin pain. I thought this was just part of the pain and weakness i have been experiencing. 
Should I mention lymphoma to my neuro? I am getting no relief at this time. All kinds of blood work has been done. Would something have shown up there?  I am at the end of my rope and just looking for answers.

THANKS

                Hello, 
I had a Melanoma removed 4 years ago on my right leg and for the last 5 months, I have a lump on the right side of my coccyx.  Since I had a pylonidal cyst removed as a teen-ager, I know this is not the same thing because it is not directly over the coccyx.  It is getting bigger and is now bothering me as I can feel it when I sit.  I lost 30 pounds without an explanation since last August and had since an MRI and a CT-Scan.  They both revealed that I have several abnormal lymph nodes in the neck and supra-clavicle but that the nodes although abnormal because they are a little bigger (.5 of an inch) and the amount of them, they suggested to continue to monitor the situation.  I am feeling a little silly to go back about the lump on my sacrum since they were not too concern about the MRI and CT-Scan but nevertheless it is still bothering be.  Does anyone have any suggestions?

I took her to the Doctor who wanted bloods and chest exray done (which all came back clear), and see him in 3 weeks. The lumps on the side and above the main one have gone and the one shaped like a bean has gone down. Then last week she got up one morning and her knuckle on her finger was sore with a lump on the side of it and she couldn't bend it, but it went over the next couple of days.  Then yesterday she gets up in the morning and her left knee is twice the size of the other and very sore to touch.  I took her to casulty then ran bloods and there is no infection but still no answer.  I'm starting to worry. She is an extremely active child, she's not loosing weight like I've read with other peoples stories but I'm really worried and don't know what to do. Should I insist on seeing a specialist? any advised would be appreciated.

My pain radiates from the inguinal lymph nodes to just above my knee.  The thigh muscles have ached for the last two years, but the last 3 months have been real intense and i have actuall lost inches in the the thighs. It feels like the more the thigh muscles hurt, the more they shrink.  I go see my dr. next week, so i was just wondering...I have lost weight as well, but my eating habits have not changed. I have had graves diesease as well, so that will be something i will bring up at the appt as well. On Jan. 10; i weighed 124, not i weigh 105, but the inches in my hips, thighs is what is scaring me and it just seems that the more the muscles there hurt, the more they shink.

                Hi,
I have been having night sweats off and on for the past four years. I will have them for several months, then they will go away for several months. My wbc has been low as well for the last couple of years. It flucuates between 3.0-4.0. I have always had energy until the last eight months. I have had EBV-mono two different times in the last seven years, I was diagnosed again with it about when my fatigue started eight months ago. My doctor sent me to a hematologist and he did a bone marrow biopsy because of the night sweats and lots of tiny swollen lymph nodes in my neck and goin. He said that they did not feel like typical lymphoma swollen lymph nodes, but almost like they were scarred that way from previous bouts of EBV-mono. They are also very small, like maybe even a little smaller than a pea. My bone marrow test came back normal and so did my chest xray. The hematologist says I don't need to worry. My doctor thinks that I have chronic EBV and chronic fatigue. My EBV numbers were the highest she has ever seen, in the 3,000 range. 
My question is whether or not I should still be concerned about lymphoma? I tend to agree with my doctor, but in the back of my mind I am still a little concerned.

I go to the VA hospital and have had many tests. They say the surgery I had in 1990 was a radical one. It has to do with a deteriorating lymphatic nerve tract. I am in constant pain in that area of surgery. Before that, I was in very good health. WHAT DO I HAVE?

The 25 US states with the highest potato consumption rates have an AIDS rate 117% lower than the other 25 states. The odds of that happening by chance are about 7752 to 1 against.

Those states also have a leukemia rate 7.5% higher with odds of about 762 to 1, and a lymphoma rate 8% higher with odds of about 708 to 1.

These numbers argue (but don't prove) that potatoes increase white blood cell counts. Has anyone ever noticed this association before? If not, I'd like to see a doctor prove or disprove the hypothesis with some blood testing. Potatoes might actually be a treatment for AIDS, and a contraindicated food for leukemia and lymphoma.

The web site mentioned above is a non-focused health study that found this association by serendipity among the 9000+ associations measured. It also found a strong association between AIDS and sunburns, and a few other factors.

                I have palmar erythema, enlarged spleen, and low blood counts, WBC's and platelets.  I have had about 10 liver funtion tests over last 2 years, all normal, and normal ultrasounds, CT scans, and liver/spleen scan except for enlarged spleen.  I have read that palmar erythema can be a presentation of leukemia, does anyone have experience with this?  I had my galbladder removed and the surgeon said my liver was fine, and my gastrointerologist says liver is good as well.  I am just wondering because I cannot get a diagnosis for my enlarged spleen, so was thinking mabie some kind of indolent lymphoma or chronic leukemia.  My low counts and red hands did not present until about 6 months ago, and my spleen has been enlarged for about 2 1/5 years.  So it seems like they are caused by the enlarged spleen.

                Hey, I am a 20 year old female.  I have had an enlarged non-tender lymph node in my neck for about 3 1/2 years.  I can not tell whether it is getting bigger or not.  Maybe just a little.  In december I also noticed an enlarged area right below my clavicle near the sternum.  It was non-tender.  I don't remember any injuries to the area.  I went to the doctor in december about the area and he ran an x-ray on it and said it was fine. It may be getting just a tad bigger too. I also had him feel the lymph node in my neck and he just said, ""It's nothing to worry about.""   He didn't run any test or anything.   I have also been having some trouble breathing. It started a while back but has gotten worse.  However, I have also gained about 60-70 lbs in the last 2 years.  I was just wondering if the trouble breathing could be due to the enlarged lymph nodes or if it was due to the weight gain.

The lumps showed up 2 months ago. He said to not ignore it get tested this maybe lymphoma, or it could just simply be a reactive gland. Well scheduled for chest xray, got blood work done and went to see the surgeon yo consult so i could schedule a surgery date for full biopsy of the large lump which appears to be 3cm. Well while waiting for my surgery date my primary dr. calls to let me know that my white blood cell count was high, 15000. I:m a 21 year old healthy female, just feel a bit run down lately.

                I have had persistant swelling of my lymph nodes in my armpits for months - I initially thought I was just gaining weight bcause I was up 2 sizes in shirts, as well as my groin has put me in a size larger pants. My armpits look like they have liquid sacks (which I thought were just fat) But one is about the size of a golf ball. In addition I have swelling behind my left knee and a tightness on my right side (are there nodes there???) I also havea few pea sized nodes behind myhead.
I am in absolutlely no pain, I have had a night sweat here or there (maybe once or twice a month). But otherwise I feel fine. No fevers, nothing. I have also noticed a increase in body odor. 

Could this be from weight gain... or stress? Or is it something else??

                Hi all,

Reaching out to you today for my girlfriend.  I'm a MedHelp forum member (MS forum), and I hope you can help me out.

My girlfriend has lipodema.  She's 38 years old and has not found a Dr who treats her condition, so like so many people do, she has been to several Drs who basically tell her there is not much they can do.  I've done some research but find mostly the same information.  Unfortunately, most discuss the wrapping, the lymphatic drainage, lap bands, heart meds, etc.  Basically, there is not much that can be done on a continual basis that I can find.  And, I know she is only going to get worse as years go on.  She's in pain daily, but does not let on, but I know her daily pain, we grew up together.  

So, my questions are, does anyone know of a Dr  or University Hospital on the East Coast who treats lipodema?  Any advice you can provide would be much appreciated.  I know this forum is not for lipodema, however I felt strongly you would be able to provide some guidance or direction.

Thank you for your time,

                The doctor found an enlarged lymph node on my son's neck during a recent physical for school. He said to watch it for a a couple of weeks to see if it would go away. He was not sick then nor is he now. After 3 weeks it was still there so. Doctor said it could be an infection, asked if he had been scratched by a cat as that could cause an infection, but then said it could be something worse. After 3 weeks it was still there. Doc put him on 600mg augmentum, so far after 1 week, no change. My question is, should I just sit back and wait for another week, or should I be more pro-active and insist on a possible biopsy? I don't know what the chances of this being a lymphoma is, but I was quite un-nerved over the way the doctor said that it could be something worse. He had bloodwork done, and it showed no infection. I know I am a worrywart, but this is my son. Thanks in advance.

''Extensive confluent retroperitoneal para aortic aorto-caval lymphadenopathy.
    Multiple enlarged nodes measuring 1 to 1.5cms seen in the aorto-caval 
    para aortic region. A large retroperitoneal lymphnode measuring 5.5 x  4 cms

He is breathless from last couple of days but NO FEVER at all in the till disease course. He doenst have a weight loss also, but has a loss of apetite. We are waiting for the Doctors appointment which is in next week.
I am confused with the disease condition, Actually my father was hospitalised at high grade fever before exactly two years for accumulation of pericardial fluid, which was eventually tapped and removed. Later that timepoint we got his lymph-biopsy done but the test was negative for malignanacy. He was recovered healthy, without any sign sympotoms later till date. Right now his condition is he has a peritoneal accumulation of fluid with lymphadenopathy. So again I m confused with the right cause.

                My little boy has been giving me cause for concern for some time now. He is 3 years old and in the 98th percentile for his height, so a big boy! Just before Chirstmas time (along with half of the country) he got the flu. He remained unwell with fluctuating temperatures from 99 to 105 and fevers for weeks. He was so poorly that he did not even get out of bed. All of his glands were enlarged and one in particular was very big  - an inch in size and visible. He recieved 3 courses of anti-biotics during that time for a suspected chest infection and  throat infection and we seemed to finally get it. He has been eating well again and has  lots more energy. However, he has had some really strange things going on. All of the pea sized glands have disappeared but the 1"" gland is still there as big as ever. It is on the right side of his neck and is deep, so difficult to feel until his head is turned up at which point you can see it. I would be ok if it were just the gland, as I know that in kids they can take forever to disapear, but he has been having other odd symptoms. He seems to hobble about in the morning like an old man when he first gets up. He often wakes up in the night with leg pains (but then so did my 17 year old when he was small), but he also has pains in his legs during the day, whilst walking around. He often asks for his feet to be made nice and warm and I must say that his feet and hands are usually quite cold. He complains of pins and needles whilst excercising. He is very pale with dark circles under his eyes (and we are both of mediteranian colouring). He has had funny rashes which started  about 4 weeks ago as follows: 

Cheeks covered in red dots which moved to the neck skipped the whole of his torsoe and sat uniformly on all of his joints. Each of his knuckles, the sides of his little toes and the balls of his feet. A few on his wrists and a few on his knees. I took him to the doctors the next day but the red blotches had faded. Since he has been well in every other aspect & I have not gone back to the docs. Every day one or two more spots come up on his face or scattered around his limbs, as the redness fades he is left with tiny pin head sized bumps. Normal skin tone. These are still there a couple of weeks later. Some areas look amost like a little patch of psorisis after the redness disappears. Still thought that it is just a perculiar viral rash that is taking its time to go but now this morning he seems to have a differnet rash again! It is areas of blotches - not welts, more like measles but in patches the size of a golf ball. They are again symetrical in their appearance on both of his legs. back of calves, side of knees and inside of thighs. He is also complaining that his back is ouchy today. But then he complains of strange things quite frequently that don't seem to develope into anything of great concern. There are two or three red spots on his back around the area he says is hurting. 

Anyone had any of these symptoms or have any children who have similar symptoms? I am stumped! I feel stupid going back to the doctors, as I did get myself in a bit of a state when I was last there in February and insist on blood tests, which came back normal. He seems healthy other than he does not look well around his eyes, but I just don't feel right about him. I have a horrible feeling inside that I might be going to lose him and I can't shake it. It is very bizarre and extremely irrational for me! 

Help me please. I am constantly worried.

                I have had swollen lymph nodes on the right side of my neck for months but haven't gotten around to start checking it propoerly until very recently. The doctor ordered a ultrasound as he wanted to check the exact location of the nodes as it appeared to be near the cartiod artery so was a bit worried about biopsy. Got the print out of the ultrasound today but don't have follow up appointment with my doctor until another week and the waiting is so hard. Can anyone help? This is what it says:

Scanning of the neck region shows a well-defined hypoechoic focus in the right lateral neck region measuring 2.08x1.44x0.46 cm. The hypoechoic focus is noted to be beneath the sternocleidomastoid muscle, adjacent and lateral to the carotid artery showing no vascularity under power Doppler imaging study. A smaller hypoechoic nodule with echogenic center is seen lateral to the aforementioned larger nodule measuring 0.80x0.46.0.41cm.

I should mention that I haven't felt particularly sick, just more tired than usual. The doctor gave me 2 weeks of antibiotic to see if the nodes would go down but they didn't. I of course hope this is something harmless but hard to wait anothe rweek.. Anyone who can offer insights? Thanks!!

                Hello,

I don't know if I am posting on the right forum or not. Or it is just my hypochondria. On The 22nd of February i started having a fever. Or atleast i thought it was. My body had this hot sensation feeling especially on my lower abdomen to legs. But my body was not warm to the touch. It has been over a week and it has now seemed to have gone down. Can fevers last for over a week? Along with fever i started having a sore throat. My throat began to get sore a couple days before i began feeling hot all over. Last friday i started having abdominal pain. I don't know if it was because of the tuna i ate but it has been here since then. It is mild but it aches. As well as mild pains on both sides of my abdomen. Usually triggered upon movement though. So i browsed online to investigate what may be going on with me. And somehow stumbled upon lymphoma. And read about it. Read that it is cancer of the nodes. I guess it showed up because one of the symptoms was fever of unknown cause. And i think i might have seen abdomen pain. So as i read that i started feeling my neck. And did feel a bit of swelling on my neck on the right side. 2-3 inches below my ear. At times when i touch it or feel it. It is a little tender. My main symptoms consist of:

Swollen node on the right side of my neck, below my ear.

Fever for a week that is now mild and going down.

Abdomen pain.

Mild chest pain every now and then.

Ever since i read that. It has consumed my mind. Having difficulties studying because i am always thinking that i might have that.  And was looking for an opinion. I had x-rays taken early 2007 for having chest pain. The x-rays turned out normal. Was diagnosed with chest wall pain. Late December of last year i had a urinary tract infection. And went to the doctor again this year on January for a general yearly check up. Had 3 different blood tests drawn. Everything was normal besides having a slight elevation of white blood cells. This was shortly after i had gotten over my urinary tract infection. At the time of my check up this year i also had a year infection. At the moment i still feel fullness of my ear. And sometimes my ear will clog up. Could the UTI i had a couple weeks before i had blood drawn have shown i had an increase of white blood cells? Or the ear infection? The ear infection was mild what i was told.

At the moment i am seeking an opinion. As to i don't know whether or not those infections i had might have caused the fever i had almost 2 weeks ago. Mainly i am concerned with the swollen lymph node i have.It isn't large. And it isn't noticable in appearance. But i can feel it when i run my fingers around my neck. It is the only one i am able to find. No swelling under my arms or groin. No nightsweats either. Just the symptoms i listed above.

I am sorry if this was an unnecessary post in the wrong forum. But this has been on my mind for the past couple of days. And have lost sleep over it. 


Thank you for your time. I didn't mean to write so much I just wanted to get out the details of everything that has happened when i first started developing symptoms.

                I've been progressively getting more fatigued, experiencing mid-back pain, have high protein levels (gammaglobulins, beta-2) and recent CT scans show enlarged lymph nodes in neck and chest as well as two small nodules in one lung.  A repeat CT scan showed a slight increase in size in the two lung nodules.  I also have Sjogren's and am told I am at a higher risk for developing lymphoma because of that.  Any suggestions or ideas?

                This is probably the wrong forum, but any ideas/thoughts from anyone would be greatly appreciated.  The following is also posted in the gastroenterology forum, but many of my symptoms could be SO many different things.  I'm always tired, I almost always have a headache, I'm always constipated no matter how much fiber I eat, I have all these little pin ***** size red spots all over my body, there's a lump in both armpits, I have little/no appetite, lots of upper mid/upper left abdominal pain, I'm nauseated quite frequently and have trouble catching my breath with even the simplest of activities, and I have this strange ""rash"" on the backs of my hands and inner left forearm that itches so bad that it hurts!  I just wish that someone could figure out what is wrong with me.

I had my gallbladder out last year and have had pain for....well seems like forever.  Finally went to a gastroenterologist today and he's ordered an endoscopy (happening tomorrow) and some blood   work.  I know basically what these tests are looking for individually, but all together?  I was hoping someone would put in their two cents on the big picture for what my new doc may possibly be thinking.  I know it's just speculation and I'll find out soon enough, but I just want opinions anyway.  The tests he ordered are as follows:  Amylase, CBC w/diff, HEP func pan (lft), h. pylori ab, total IGA, tTG, IgA   lipase 

Thanks for any thoughts.  I'll post results of the endoscopyEndoscopy

user_424497,vids68,/posts/Leukemia-and-Lymphoma-/Cancerjolt--Why-My-Family-/show/441025,Cancerjolt- Why My Family? ,"
                My family consisting of my parents, myself the eldest daughter, a brother 3 years younger to me, a sister 1 year younger to him and a kid brother 12 years younger to me, were a happy fun-filled family of 6 till the 26th of January 2008. Although each one of us was busy in our own fields the sense of satisfaction the each one is safe and doing well was the binding force. 
On the 26th of January when the whole of India was resting after the Republic day celebrations, we had a Tsunami in our family. My brother just 36 years of age slipped into coma due to a massive cerebral hemorrhage. Our life just stopped at that stage. The first question that came to my mind was: why us? Why my family? and why he? He was an obedient son, a caring brother, a loving husband, and a doting father to an 8 year old.  A pure vegetarian and a fitness freak with a good amount of time spent in the gym under the guidance of a trainer and a non smoker and only social drinking in moderation, which he had given up as a part of his New Year’s Resolution.  Our family has a genetic longevity schedule. My paternal grandfather lived till he was 97 and my paternal grandmother was 84 when she passed away.  My maternal grandfather lived till the age of 70, while my maternal grandmother is now 78.  It is still not making any sense to me that my brother is no more at 36. 
On that fateful Saturday afternoon my brother had an excruciating headache.   He skipped his lunch and asked his wife to just give him oats kanchi to drink. After drinking this he vomitted and experienced dizziness.  My parents were called and they rushed to his apartment. He was lying down and seeing my father said, ""Appa take me to hospital"". Meanwhile some neighbours had collected and had called up the nearest medical facility. One neighbour was good enough to escort him.   At the hospital, just a kilometre away, he was lead to the casualty section where a doctor was ready to see him. His blood pressure was taken and it was ""normal"". Meanwhile the headache increased. He was put on drips and taken to his room on the upper floor for further treatment. However, on the way itself he had collapsed and when he was put on the cot he was unconscious.  He had suffered a cardiac arrest (as revealed by the doctor later).  The doctors rushed and resuscitated his heart.   However he never regained consciousness.   A CT Scan was taken.   It revealed a rupture in the brain stem.   Blood count was very low. The Neurophysician told us that the blood platelets were too low, just about 15000 instead of a lakh.  The WBC was too high. 'No surgeon will touch him in this condition. He will bleed to death if operated in this state', said the Neuro.  
He was immediately shifted to the best hospital in town.   Arrangements were made to increase the blood platelets. To reduce the pressure on the brain, an incision was made to drain off the fluid retained inside. Doctors declared a 48 hour critical period. They said he was 'brain dead'. The brain should be activated for any further action. The blood platelets did increase to a reasonable level, internal bleeding also stopped; however the brain continued to be inactive. 
The sentence was pronounced; he had leukemia……Something vaguely called as Acute pro myeloid Leukemia.  This is something that is seen only in Hindi Movies.  The hero is taken to the hospital where is pronounced to have the deadly disease, but even there the hero lasts for 3 to 3 ½ hours before the end  and movies generally have a happy ending!!  That was not to be in our case.  We tried contacting every influential person in the medical fraternity.  His case was circulated to every known oncologist in India and the U.S.  but each one had the same answer, “treatment can be started only if he comes out of coma, whatever has been done so far is right and the best done.”  My brother was on life support and an emergency operation was performed to relieve the pressure in the brain.  We were informed that the operation was successful and the hemorrhage had stopped but he had to come out of coma.  They said that the next 24 hours could be the deciding factor.  The doctors had little hope and asked us to start praying for a miracle.  
It is here that we saw the fraternity at pray.  Within the next 12 hours, all our relatives from every corner of India joined us.  Every hug and the tears that we shed when we saw them made us stronger and bound us together further.  We were really hopeful that all our prayers together will pull him out of the dark cave that he had gone into, each person was trying to get the attention of his devout God.  All faith merged into one and fought the Lord Yama.  All this kept our spirit of fighting alive.  We wanted to snatch him back from God.  Since the 24 hours was up, we had to give consent to remove him from life support.  We literally fought with the medical team and demanded to know why he cannot come back like many a miracle that has happened all round the world.  When they told us that he was brain-dead, we refused to believe it and proposed to have an EEG done.  There was no portable EEG machine available at our city and through our known sources we arranged for one in a matter of hour and an EEG was conducted.  We asked the doctors to wait through the night and conduct a second EEG after a 24-hour gap for look for progress or deterioration.  It was as if he gave us every opportunity to try and hold him back, but he did not want to put us through the decision of removing him from life support.  Minutes after the EEG procedure was done, and the machine removed, his blood pressure came down drastically and no amount of medication worked to stabilize it.  He breathed his last at 10:15 that night, blissfully unaware of the waves of emotions that he had unleashed.  The tearful goodbyes that we bade him and our efforts to console our parents and ourselves is a scene that will stay imbibed in my mind for life.  No parent, sibling, wife or child should ever have to undergo this loss and trauma.
Now on retrospection, I think, how could he have lived looking and feeling healthy if he had such a disease.  He had absolutely no symptoms.  The earlier week he and his family had gone on a picnic for a day with their circle of friends where they played a lot of badminton, did some tree-climbing etc.  Obviously a person with leukemia would have shown some stress and signs of tiring.  He wanted to ride the bike from Bombay to Poona on that fateful Saturday. I have tried to soak up every bit of information on Leukemia but I have not been very successful.  All sites tell me that the symptoms are tiresome, lack of stamina and strength and sore throat and cold like symptoms, but ever for these we need time for treatment? Isn’t it? One day you land up with a fever you do not go in for a blood check. A common cold generally is said to last for a week, if it does not get better by then, then you tend to take some action.  Some of the unanswered questions are: Did we neglect his symptoms or were there no overt symptoms? Has any one experienced anything like this, who can share their agony with us and reduce our feeling or guilt and helplessness?

I went in with her today and asked all the questions I could for her.  Her doctor never talks things over with her and of course being in her 80's but really go mind and energy until now doesn't ask questions either.  So He finally talk and told her what she has and even for the first time wrote it down/ of course you could bearly read it.  Any way I'm just trying to check every thing out to help her.  No kids and her husband has passed away 10 years ago.  Rest of family don't hardly come around except when they thought she was dieing than they showed up like vultures.   Thanks

                Hi everyone,

I am not sure this is the place to post, but I hope someone will be nice enough to help me. My question is: are there lymph nodes on the exterior of the abdominal wall? When I feel my abdominal muscles(the ones between the hip and the ribcage, lateral) I feel something like bumps or maybe striations; they seem to be the same on both sides. Are there lymph nodes there or it is just the normal appearance of those muscles

Thanks

I am experiencing fatigue, unexplained weight loss, swollen glands (neck,groin,armpits), severe lower back pain, and tingling in my hands/feet. My Dr. did blood work- the CBC showed Low WBC-2.7, Low Neutrophils-38%, High Eos-8%, and LOW ""Alert"" Neutrophils Absolute-1.0 

After these results my Dr suggested an HIV test. I did that and it came back negative. Now I am going to a hematologist/oncologist. My GP wrote a script for a bone marrow biopsy/aspiration. Is this necessary and if so, what could be the cause of all of this??? Any ideas or any similar experiences would be great. Thanks so much!! : )

                Hello. I'm asking this question about my daughter. She is losing her mind,scared she has lymphoma. She is 27 years old and has pelvic pain for several years, on her left side. The doctor thinks she has endometriosis or some adhesions. In the last month her left groin lymph node has become enlarged and hurts. She won't leave it alone, constantly feeling it and freaking out. She has an ultrasound of her lymph node, one of her ovaries etc. She has had a CT scan of her whole pelvic region. She has had a CA-125, CEA, CBC with differential, her lymphocytes checked. Everything checks out normal. Even the enlarged lymph node is within normal limits. The only thing that hasn't been done is a biopsy of it. The lymph node is very tender, movable. Her whole groin is in a lot pain though. Any ideas what could cause this? And are there other tests to rule out her worst nightmare? Could her pushing on it etc, make it stay large? Thanks for any help:)

I've had an infection in the past so he thinks they just never went down. He did a CBC and all my cells were normal. The weird thing is though I have to bruises that came out of nowhere, my gums are somewhat tender in certain spots and bleed when I brush them...and i was itchy all over last night. I'm taking wellbutrin SR....but I just dont see how that medicine could be causing all of this.I'm 20 yrs old.

                Hello, I'm new here so bare w/ me. Well I geuss I'm just a concerned mom worrying for her 5 yr. old daughter soon to be 6 in one month. I found one swollen lymph node on the left side of her neck approx. 2 yrs. ago I kept an eye on it and after approx. 6 mos. brought it to her pediatricians attention. She reassured me that it was normal for lymph nodes to swell and she recommends keeping an eye on it she checked other areas for other swollen lymph nodes and found three more more under her jaw on the right side. She ordered a blood test and said everything was fine. So I continued to watch them not wanting to return to see her Dr. because she made me feel I was overreacting over something that was normal. I recently noticed the one on the left side looked larger so I made another appt. to see her Dr.. The first time I took her in was 1 1/2 yrs. ago and they have never gone away or decreased in size they have slowly increased. When I took her in the Dr. found the one on the left was larger and was actually 2 lymph nodes and also found 2 new ones on the back of her neck. She referred my daughter to an ENT and I am now awaiting the referral. I am wanting to know what are a few possibilities for this and what is most likely the cause what should I expect?

                I had an infection on the top of my head on the right side and the lymph nodes near the bottom of my neck near my collar bone flared up which is expected. Then along with that im guessing it spread cause on my left side under my chin swelled up into a golf ball size so the nodes on my left side flared up.

My point is that its been about a month in a half since the infection ceased. I've heard that the nodes can stay flared up, they havent changed size.I don't have any fever or like night sweats or anything like that. I have other symptoms of being drowsy and feeling drugged but I think thats because of the Wellbutrin SR I'm taking.

Im 20 years old. These nodes are soft and they can move around and what not, and none of them are larger than an inch. Should I be worried about Lymphoma like HD or NHL

                I have a 16-mos. old grand-daughter.  Since approximately Nov. 2007, she had a cold, fever, cough.  My daughter was consistent in taking her to doctor visits and ER visits because she was not getting better.  
On doctor visits, she was told she had a nasal virus, on another visit she was told she had a throat virus.  One time I took her to a doctor appt. and was told she still had a virus and she would get over it.  I asked the doctor to do a chest x-ray because her breathing wasn't normal.  At first, the doctor didn't want to, but I persisted and said my daughter had requested one be done.  The doctor complied.  Later that evening, there was something abnormal with x-ray.  On one of the visits, doctor/nurse tried to draw blood, but because she couldn't find a vein, was told that maybe next time the would draw blood out.  One of the next visits, same thing happened.
Last week the baby was taken to a doctor visit, still said she had a virus.  Next day, Tues., she was taken to the ER and the doctor told my daughter that she could have taken her to her primary doctor  instead of taking her to the ER and the doctor refused to draw blood out.  My daughter made an appt. to see primary and ask for a complete physical.  The receptionist told her that she could only make an appt. for a follow-up and not for a physical.  My daughter requested to speak to the doctor, but instead was transferred to the office manager.  Office manager with my daughter's permission to look into the medical file, said she would see what she could do.  Anyways, the baby went to the doctor Thursday (seen by a new doctor because the previous one had been transferred).  Blood was drawn and later that day at 9p.m., the doctor called to take the baby to the ER - ASAP because her blood lever was extremely low.  She had to have blood transfusions.  At 11:00 p.m., she was diagnosed with leukemia.  A bone marrow and spinal tap were done.  She does not have the usual children's leukemia.  Still waiting on result from bone marrow, was sent out for further analysis.  
My question:  With all the doctor visits and follow-up appts. shouldn't something have been done sooner and if so, wouldn't she have been treated with medication instead of this illness progressing and the initial treatment have been so extreme?  Thanks you for listening and for your input.

                I hope that someone, anyone will answer at least this post.  I've made some other posts about myself, but I am truly scared for my three year old little girl.  She has had enlarged lymphnodes in her neck since Thanksgiving.  They are getting larger and larger and harder and harder.  Even after antibiotics for an ear infection (one side) the nodes in her neck, BOTH sides, from behind her ears down just keep growing.  She almost always has a runny nose (for no aparent reason, allergy meds do nothing).  At night she sweats so much that I have to change her sheets every day.  She always feels warm, almost feverish, though it is VERY difficult to take the temp of a toddler so I rarely do it.  The only thing I remember from her cbc that I caught a glimps of is that her absolute lymphs was marked high.  Her white cell count was high and her hematocrit was low.  (I think that is what the white cell and hematocrit were, I do know they were marked)  What do I do to get the docs to do more tests, and what tests should be run to make sure that these lymphnodes are truly nothing to be worried about?  What should I be looking for in her blood work to make sure that I'm getting the whole story???

                I have been in remission for 1 yr from aggressive stage 4 non-hodgkins. My numb chin syndrome started in the very beginning before any Rchop  treatments.(The vincristine did cause numb toes& fingers.) My concern now is that my opposite jawline (not the chin area) and neck became numb right after treatments ended.  The neurologist says it is the cancer but the mri and scans are okay.  After a year I still am the same. Is there anyone else with this?

                I had my gallbladder removed in November of '07.  I have been having what feels like gallbladder attacks off and on since then.  One of the attacks lasted for eight hours and was bad enough to send me to the ER though they did no imaging of my abdomen and did only blood work that came back ""fine""  (not normal mind you, they simply said ""fine"").  I now have pain upper left/middle abdomen almost all the time.  My doc said to take Prilosec to see if it was reflux or something, which it obviously isn't since the prilosec does nothing.  Now, as of yesterday morning, I have pain in my back that is so severe when I move that I cannot help but cry out in pain.  I can't go from standing to sitting or sitting to standing without the pain.  Just came from doc's office and he checked all up and down my back and there was NO pain when he pressed anywhere on my back.  He ordered a CT with contrast, but do not yet know when the scan will take place.  He says that the pain in my back is referred pain from either my stomach or pancreas.  I hate waiting and he won't even tell me what he thinks it could possibly be.  I had previously been diagnosed with high blood pressure and put on meds, but I haven't taken them in two months or so and my blood pressure is dropping with each visit.  Today it was 127/72 where three months ago it was 148/94.  I have a slightly enlarged spleen (diagnosed with that well over a year ago) and I am ""slightly anemic"".  I have all these little red pin ***** size dots all over my torso and arms and a little on my legs.  I am completely exhausted all the time and get so short of breath with the smallest amount of activity I am beginning to really worry that something is very wrong and it's hiding just out of the doctor's reach, you know?  What the heck is going on with me!?!???

I'm a 30 year old man.   About 3 months ago I started having chest pain which is upper central,  and 'heavy' in nature.   It doesn't get any worse with exercise.   I also started having problems keeping my heart rate below 100, I even had a rate of 160 in my sleep, I   was just wondering,  I don't know about the tachycardia,  but could swolen or enlarging lymph nodes in my chest (ones you can't feel by touch) be causing the chronic chest pain / heaviness sensation?   I have also had 3 bad viral colds since this all started,  and before this I had maybe  3 viral colds/infection in the last 5 YEARS.      

I had a normal chest xray, echocardiogram, all kind of labs including CBC, chemistry, liver, TSH, T4, cardiac enzymes, d-dimer,  none of these tests were revealing 
Any ideas?   Could this be a swelling lymph node in my chest making me feel this sensation?

                Has anyone ever heard of a 12 year old having a lump on the chest just below the collarbone from EBV?  My daughter just tested positive for EBV but is asymptomatic other than tiredness when exercising (well, she had a small cold last week but it included nasal congestion, not just a sore throat like most mono) - NO fever, general fatigue, sore throat, swollen glands in neck, etc.  She had a CT scan and an x-ray before the bloodwork came back that both showed no mass and no lymph node enlargement according to the radiologist.  Yet she has a firm (but not hard), immoveable, visible and palpable lump about 1 1/2 inches long that the pediatrician says could be explained by the mono (although they said no lymph node enlargement).  She has an appt. with a pediatric surgeon, but I am afraid that we will just get blown off now that she's tested positive for EBV.  Maybe that really is the answer, but the lump has not gotten smaller in about three weeks (and may have been there for 4-5 weeks according to a friend who is a p.a. and saw it on her but didn't think much of it at the time), and I'm not thrilled about waiting around until the mono is gone to see if it goes away.  Has anyone seen this before?  I can't find any mention of chest lumps and EBV, and most chest lumps seem to not be a good sign.  Should I try to insist on a biopsy if the surgeon doesn't want to do one?  Any other suggestions? Thanks.

                In December of 2004 my Mom was diagnosed with endometrial cancer, 54 white female nonsmoker not over weight.  She had a complete hysterectomy and 18 lymph nodes sampled. It was determined that her cancer was Stage IA, there were no signs of lymph node involvement and she would need no further treatment.  Last spring she began noticing some slight pain in her left hip and lower back that she attributed to a couple times she had slipped and over stretched.  After our dog (a boxer) jumped into her right side causing her to shift the pain became much more intense and eventualy subsided.  Over the summer she had all kinds of tests, x rays, bone scans, blood work and everything came back normal.  Physical therapy helped the problem some but never completely got rid of it.  A cortisone shot in September resulted in a fever and  intense pain for about a day or 2.  In September a catscan showed she had some swollen lymph nodes on the left and right illiac chains.  A biopsy came back negative.  Worried that the biopsy could have missed, repeated the catscan 6 weeks later, stable to the first one.  The catscan was repeated 3 months later and this time it came that a lymph node on the left external illiac chain had enlarged to 5.5 x 3.2 from 3.8 x 2.3 in November and another biopsy is now scheduled.  The oncologist is concerned that the lymph node pressing on a nerve causing the pain.  However, she has had this pain since May of 2007.  She is still having pain, while not extreme or unbearable it is enough to be an annoyance in her daily life and limit her activities.  When she complains that the pain is worse it seems o be the result of a specific event i.e., tripping, walking in nyc, etc.  A back doctor seemed to think that it is from arthritis.  Could the behavior of this lymph node and the pain be caused by anything other than a cancer returning?  She has no other symptoms such as persistent fever, weightloss or itching, she is tired but has always complained of being tired.

                My fiance who is 36 years of age has been having symptoms that i am worried about. She recently went for an exam. She took 3 different blood tests on monday. On wednesday the nurse called her and said they found something in her blood to be elevated. She was scheduled to go back in a month. But the nurse said they wanted her to come back next week after they got the results. They want her to go in for an ultrasound. Her symptoms are consistant with this cancer and has me extremely worried for her. Here are her symptoms. Her first symptom started a year ago. Which was abdomen pain.

1.Abdomen pain, sometime would be severe pain. Which she saw a doctor in december and told her to take prilosec. Which would help calm the pain. 
2. Vomitting, she has vomitted very little blood sometimes. She usually only vomits after being stressed out. She doesn't vomit occasionally. She sometimes does feel nausea. But usually after being stressed out
3. Last week she had a nose bleed. Only nose bleed she's had in the year her first symptom started. 
4. mild pain on her hips
5. easily bruised, noticed when she hit her knee on the computer desk. But she has told me she has always bruised easily. 

Her most common symptoms are usually stomach pain that is calm. And sometimes is calm when taking the prilosec otc. But then again the blood results have me worried. She did have the flu a week before she saw the doctor on monday. I don't know if that can have an effect on the results or not.

I am worried about her. And wish her to live a long and healthy life. Is there a strong chance that she may have it? If it is, does leukemia respond well to treatment? Its not too late to start treatment only after noticing her first symptoms for almost a year now.

Any advice would be great. I am losing sleep everynight over this. Can't stand the thought of something happening to her. 

Thank you for your time.

                Hello,

I am a 24 yr old female and completed 6 cycles of ABVD, in addition to IV of Decadron/Zofran 5 or 6 times a month for nausea. Thankfully, the Hodgkins seems to be all gone according to the CT scans. I did my last treatment on 11/30/07 and last received Decadron/Zofran on 12/3/07. I am very thankful that the cancer is gone, but I do have a concern. Two weeks after treatment was over, I gained ten pounds rapidly (in the course of about two weeks). This weight has settled in my abdomen, and no matter how many situps and crunches I do, it won't go away. I exercise for at least 45 minutes every day (cardio) and watch what I eat - I allow myself one serving of something sweet per day and my calorie intake is about 1500 - 1800 a day.

My question is, is this weight gain something normal post-chemo/post-steroid use? Prior to this, my weight never went above 125, and my baseline weight was usually 122. Now, it is at 135 or so and won't budge. I know that it is really not that big of a deal, but I was just wondering if it was something other patients experience post-chemo and how long it takes for these medicines and the steroid to be out of my system. Any help/experiences of others would be greatly appreciated. I feel quite silly approaching my doctor about this, especially since I was lucky enough to be rid of the cancer.

Thanks,
Iwillsurvive

                My symptoms have been neurological pain/numbness in my extremities.  To rule out lymphoma, I had a CT (neck, chest, abdomen) scan 6 months ago which revealed lesions in my liver, kidney and pancreas - the organs were also somewhat enlarged.  A liver biopsey was scheduled but later canceled because the lesions were too small.  An ultrasound revealed the lesions were most likely cysts, which were not indicative of lymphoma.  Yesterday my doctor examined me and felt a lymph node under my right arm.  She ordered blood tests and another CT (neck, chest, abdoman) scan.  I am 58 years old and I have had quite a few x-rays over the years and I am concerned about continued exposure to radiation.  Is an MRI or PET scan a better, lower risk alternative?  I have not scheduled the CT scan yet as I want more information.  Thanks for your help!  Cliff

                Whats up people?


I will try to make this short as possible. Last year in June 2007, I suffered a heat stroke at the park. Went to the hospital because my heart was pounding like as if it was going to come out my throat. Anyway....I found out I had Mitral valve prolapse and the doctor told me I can continue playing basketball. I didn't! I wasn't active anymore. I stopped playing ball, I stopped all my activities. The last few months I noticed my lymph nodes swelling on the side of my chin, when it first came, it wasn't noticeable. The last 2-3 weeks, it's sore and painful and it enlarged! It feels I have 2 next to each other. One slightly below my chin and one along my chin line. 

Went to the doctor to get it checked out.....he told me it didn't feel like lymph nodes. However, he gave me antibiotics to take (and eye drops because on my right side my eye is puffy with discoloration and left has minor discoloration) He did a CBC and he checked my urine. All came back normal. However, my cholesterol was borderline as well as my blood pressure. I don't know what it could be. I have a tooth ache on the same side of my face that I have the swollen lymph nodes are. I don't know if thats a factor. I would like to point out that when I was on the antibiotics, (Amox Tr-K CLV 875-125) it did make them go down a lot, but once my meds finished, it came back. Also this med made my stomach upset and gave me diarrhea, and made my groin swell up and i was in pain from it. Once I stopped taking it, it all went away. I have no insurance because Im part time at my job and go to school full time. I'm 24 years of age. The lymph nodes on the side of my chin are tender to the touch and is slightly red. What is this a sign of?

                I'm new here ... forgive my ignorance.  I'll give you the cliff note version of what's going on with me...

I was scheduled for L3-L4 discectomy / decompression and as a result of my pre-op testing and blood work.  I was called by my surgeons office who indicated that i have a ""Suspicious R-Wave"" in my EKG and referred me to my family doctor.  Upon meeting with my family doctor, she indicated that the EKG ""is no worries at all""  however it was learned that my Nucleated Red Blood Count was at 16.4%.  I asked her what the NRBC should be and she said ""as an adult, I shouldn't have ANY""  She sent me for additional blood tests ... that's where I'm at now.  She is unwilling / unable to answer any questions I have.

As a result of not getting info from my doc, I came home and ""Googled"" Nucleated Red Blood Cells and found that most of the topics indicate that I've got enemia or lukemia...let me rewind for a second - while at the doctors office, she indicated that it is NOT enemia because my total red blood count is fine ... which leads me to lukemia ?!?!?!?!

I'm a 35 year old relatively fit male, not that this means much of anything becuase I know that illness will attack regardless...sorry - got lost for a minute in emotion.

I guess my question is ... is leukemia the only response to having nucleated red blood cells ???  I'm having a real hard time finding answers on line because most of the topics i find are ""among new borns"" or ""among critically ill."" .. none for the 35 year old relatively healthy, fit male....note:  I'm white, so it's not sickle cell which is another topic i found a bunch of information on.

Thanks in advance for any help you may be able to give ...

I had swollen cervical nodes, which have diminished some, on my left side..2 of which I can't feel anymore, the other one is pea size..I can still feel it.  I just metion that because I feel like because I had those swollen nodes I may be a little more sensitive or paranoid about these that I've had for awhile.

                My 46 y/o husband, who has CLL, will be starting Fludarabine chemo treatments on Monday due to an enlarged spleen. He will continue receiving the treatments monthly(for 5 consecutive days) over the course of 6-8 months. If there's anyone out there who received treatments with Fludarabine &/or other chemo drugs & does not mind helping me out, I've listed some questions I have related to precautions & side effects of Fludarabine:

1) Because my husband went prematurely grey & bald close to 10 years ago, will he grow back hair if he loses it due to the chemo? If so, will it come back grey since he lost his natural color pre-chemo, or could it come back his natural color or another one?

2) Does my husband have to take any precautions at home because of the chemo? For example: Does he have to flush the toilet twice every time he goes? Can he still go bowling every other weekend(he & I are on a couples league)? Should he avoid cigarette smoke, smoky places, &/or contact with people who smoke? Even though he doesn't clean our cats litterpan, are there any issues to having cats in the home during this time? Since he can't have fresh fruits or veggies, can he still have canned ones? Are there other foods he needs to avoid? 

I know I've asked ALOT of questions, but the oncologist was vague when we talked to him and basically said just to avoid sick people & no traveling during the week my husband is getting the chemo treatments. 

Thanks ahead of time to anyone who responds.

                Around Jan 7 I noticed two areas of swellings on my left side of the head..they itched and were painful to the touch, even moving the hair was painful.  I also noticed 3 swollen nodes on the left side of the neck in a chain.  I saw the Dr (not mine)and she said she was concerned and did a CBC..it was normal..the swellings on my head were swollen lymph nodes...she gave me 500 mg levaquin for a possible infection.  I saw my DR a week later and she said that we'll watch the nodes week by week.  The next week i went in and she said the nodes were shrinking and they had shrunk 2/3..I could still easily feel them, though.  She said they were about .5 cm now. The head nodes were gone..she said no need to come back.
I developed a painful 1cm red bump on the lower left side head near where one of the head swellings was and so i decided to see a dermatologist this week..he said it was nothing, just a inflamed scalp bump and that my neck nodes were fine...even though I can still feel them..is that ok..to still feel them, even if they are smaller than .5cm?  I don't want to seem paranoid, but i hate that I still can feel those nodes in my neck..I just don't want to worry anymore..they are not painful and they roll around easily.   Thanks in advance for your time..I just need to find some peace of mind.

                My son is 19 and over the past 6-9 months has not been feeling well.  He has experienced bouts of diarrhea, upper left abdominal pain, vomitting, sore throat, shortness of breath, night sweats, insomnia, and unexplained nose bleeds where there is considerable blood flow. I am not a physician, just going off of a mothers intuition, but am concerned that he may have some form of leukemia or other blood disorder.   He does not currently have medical insurance, so has not been to see a physician. Any thoughts ??

                I am a 40 year old male. 6 weeks ago I noticed two enlarged lymph nodes on the left side of my neck. one is exactly in the middle of the neck and another one is in the area where neck meets the shoulder. At that time I had cold and fever. 

I went to my doctor he prescribed an mild antibiotic and asked me to come back in two weeks if the node doesn't disapear of shrink. After I finished my antibiotic I noticed that the Lymph node is growing bigger. Went back to my doctor, he asked to go for a blood work. The RBC count was below normal(4.16) and hemoglobin was 11.5 .  The WBC count was slightly higher that my previos bllod work which was taken three months ago durin my annual physical exam. The WBC count went up from 3.9 to 6.8 but still with in the range. 

Since the lymph node was growing he asked me to go to a general Surgeon and told me that the surgeon will perform a biopsy on the node. When I went to Surgeon he asked me to go for a Ultra sound and a chest Xray. The UltraSound report come back and said that one node is 5.9cm x 1.3cm x .8 cm and another one is 2.2 x 1.0 x 1.0 cm and they appear to be cystic or necretic and suggsted to take a MRI or CT scan. I will be going for a CT Scan soon. The X ray of the Chest was didn't say anythig - everything was clear in the chest. I don't know why my General Surgeon doesn't want to perform a boipsy right away. The node is still growing. It is visible from  outside now. I am worried about Lymphoma. As of now I don't have any fever. I have slight headache. Should I insist my Surgeon to take the biopsy... 

Some times when I press the nodes it is sore.  

I also noticed between the last blood work and the current blood work the Absolute Neutrophils count went up from 2300 to 5100 and the Neutrophils count went up from 60 to 73 and Lyphocytes count went down from 31 to 18. 

I would appreciate any suggestion. I live in SF bay area. Should I see a Hematologist or Oncologist now.

                Hello, my 2 1/2 yr old daughter has been sick for the past week with high fevers, runny nose, headache, just generally tired and lots of bruises on her legs and she hasn't fallen or anything. For the past few months she has been losing her hair. She is starting to have bald spots and I am really worried about her having leukemia or something bad. I am adopted and 2 kids under the age of 5 on my birthmother's side of the family have died from that. My oldest son has down syndrome and he already gets screened for it every 6 months. Do you think I have anything to be worried about? I called today and set an appointment up for her. If its not something like that what else could it be? I guess sometimes I'm afraid we pay so much attention to our son with down syndrome that we forget to look at our other 2.

                My 12-year-old son has large lymph nodes in the right side of his neck.  I have had him to the doctor twice and she has treated him with Keflex then Augmentin.  He also had some sort of strange inflammation on his scalp.  The second time she did blood work which she said was normal - and sent him for an ultrasound which showed many large lymph nodes, but two that were 1 cm or larger which the radiologist called ""suspicious.""  The radiologist suggested a follow up ultrasound after the antibiotic is finished, but the doctor said the ultrasound was not concerning to her (I guess because the blood work was normal).  In the meantime the antibiotic is finished and he still has the large nodes.  He also has been complaining occasionally of intense itching which I have to give him Benadryl for.  I did not connect this because he has had problems with his skin since he was little (ezcema, hives, etc).  He has also complained of a sore throat in the morning.  Should I be concerned or should I wait it out?

                 don't even know where to begin. I thought this was something sexual related, since it occured 2 weeks after intercourse with a man (I'm female) but I've now had a seven month HIV NEGATIVE along with a PCR DNA negative and 11 other HIV tests all in between. 

So here's how it began. 
I've always had enlarged tonsils, later a heart problem that developed after the birth of my daughter (2000), recurring uveitis for the past two years... 

so in August my tonsils swelled up to where they touched eachother, and I developed night sweats. The tonsils didn't hurt, and there was one swollen lymph node under my chin. Eventually I was given a tonsillectomy, but the low grade fever, night sweats, flushing, all intermittent. Excessive fatigue that will not go away. Chills. Skin changes (rash on back, on legs), swollen painful lymphnodes on collarbone and tops of legs, and on back of one knee. flushed apperance on the face in the evenings, I just don't feel good :( I used to be overly hyper :) OCD in my cleaning, happy-go-lucky. What the heck happened? 

Here's lab work: 
HIV Antibodies at 6, 9, 10, 18,19,21,22, 27 and 30 weeks... excessive much ::) 
HIV DNA PCR negative at 5 months 
HIV ICMA Negative at 5 months 
Mono spot and strep test negative 
CBC normal - neutrophils and platelets slightly elevated 
Sed rate 8 
Thyroid panel normal 
ANA normal 
ANCA NORMAL
CRP 0.50
HLA-B27 POSITIVE 
Heart function normal 
EBV shows past infection (long ago) 
CMV shows past infection (long ago) 
CT scan shows mild lymph nodes, nothing characteristic of cancer or that they feel needs biospy but i was on prednisone at the time


If anyone can point me in any directions, I'd appreciate it. I focused on HIV for so long because it followed a sexual encounter, however the guy I was with tested negative with a rapid test 6 weeks after we had sex, and I've had all these negative tests, so symptoms and timing coincidence are just that - coincidence... I need to get to the bottom of what is going on. Please? 

My current symptoms are immense pain in lymphnodes with swelling, especially in collarbone and shoulders, knees and groin, forearm and underarms, low grade fever and fatigue with depression from being ill, intermittent night sweats... PLEASE give me any ideas you may have.

Thanks

                  Hi, Everybody.  I am a 39 year old female, and I have been having some troublesome symptoms for approx. 6-7 mo.. I am the mother of 5 children and very active, so when I started experiencing some pain in my legs and hips, I ignored it.  I just thought it was related to working out.   But, then I started having the pain regardless of my activity level and I realized it was more joint or bone pain, not muscular.  I still ignored it and just treated it with Advil.  It wasn't until I was washing my face one day and felt a lump under the left side of my jaw, about the size of a large grape, that I decided to go to the doctor.  He was not overly concerned, but he did notice that I had lost about 12 pounds, and given the fact that the lymph node was visble and firm and fixed,  he ordered a CT.  It came back showing several enlarged nodes, most too deep to feel.  None of them were considered suspicious according to the radiologist, and he recommended watching them.  My Dr. agreed.  In the meantime, we have moved to another state.  I have kept an eye on the lymph node and it hasn't changed, but I seem to have another, in the same spot on the right side and it is harder. I still get the pain in my legs and hips, and in the past month or so I have begun to experience the chills so badly, I can't get warm.  I layer clothing and use blankets, but I just have to sit and wait it out.  I am also really fatigued.  Although, Things have been stressful, so that could be the reason.  A couple of weeks ago, I started feeling ill.  Nothing specific, just not well.  The chills got worse, and the whole left side of my face and neck hurt. I went to the doctor, and I was told my blood tests ""didn't show anything that indicates a serious bacterial infection.""  Then he said, maybe you have the flu, so just go home let me know if you get worse.  He also said that I needed to get the lymph node biopsied, but that he didn't do that, and I needed to go to an ENT.  Well, I'm not better and I made an appointment to go back.  My left ear hurts off and on, and I my left tonsil is swollen. (I think it's my tonsil)  I don't have a ""sore throat"".  It's achy, and the pain is is throughout the left side of my face and neck.  I have a low grade fever off and on.  

    I am concerned, and I feel blown off by doctors.  I wasn't really happy when my first doctor wanted to wait, but I didn't want to come off as being paranoid, so I went along with it.  I have a strong history of cancer on on both sides of my family, including Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma, Hodgkin's Lymphoma, and CLL.  My mom had Non- Hodgkin's and her doctor's didn't find it for almost a year.  Her blood work was always normal, even at the time of her diagnosis.  She had given up, and was at a doctor for a shoulder injury when an new Dr saw the lump and asked her about it..  He had it CT'd that day, biopsied the next, and she started Chemo for stage 3 lymphoma, 4 days later. 

  Am I concerned over nothing?  How can I express my concern to my doctor without feeling like a hypochondriac?  This is a little scary to me.  I don't want to be sick, but more than that, I don't want to be even more sick later, because my doctor isn't listening.

                I have had this lymph node for a few years. I recently noticed (a few months ago) that it started changing shape. It does not hurt at all, nor has it gotten bigger or worse, it's simply changing as if it's splitting in two. I'm not sure what to make of this but nobody I know seems to care or would be willing to schedule an appointment. Please shed me some knowledge on what is happening. Here's a picture to show you what I mean. The lymph node is on the left side of my head, where the neck meets the scalp.

I had a follow up MRI done last week, of the neck, which said ""multiple bilateral cervical chain lymph nodes identified predominantly within the precartoid space with the largest on the left measuring 1.8x.5x6 cm and the largest on the right measuring 1.8x.6x.5 cm."" Neither hurt nor am I aware of them, however, I have been feeling incredibly tired lately, I have night sweats, and no appetite. I've also had random swelling in my left groin and armpits. This has been going on for months. My PCP said the results are normal and just ignore the first finding. The only significant blood findings I have had are EBV Ab VCA IgG of 1577 and EBV Nuclear Antigen Ab IgG of 1023. Should I be concerned? Should I get another opinion, and if so, with what type of doctor? I just feel miserable! Thanks in advance for ANY advice you might have..

                Since I was about 7, I have had one large lymph node just under my ear and jaw on my right side. It doesnt hurt, and, doesnt seem to be growing. Just hard. I am unable to push it around or anything. I was always tired, and, was tested for mono. which I believe came out negative.

I am not in my mid 20's, and, have swollen lymph nodes throughout my entire body. The large lymph node under my ear on the right side is still there, I have a swoller one right under my chin, underarm, and about a dozen in my groin.

I had an ultrasound done on my largest one under my ear, came back fine.

I am suffering from consistent fatigue, mental fogginess, poor memory, digestive problems, constipation, very dry skin, facial redness, acne, occasional flushing, ice cold hands and feet, low muscle mass, increased fat storage in my lower abdomen, finger nail ridging, as well as, poor concentration.

I am between doctors right now, but, I am hoping to visit one eventually.

What do these symptoms mean ?

                Hi, I was wondering if someone can explain what these results mean - I am not scheduled to see my doctor for another month and would like to understand before hand.  This was for a suspected diagnosis of polycythemia vera. Thanks! 
HISTORY:
Source of Specimen: Bone marrow.

Elevated HGB, ? polycythemia.

GROSS:
1. Labeled with patient's name and hospital registration number.
Received in B5 fixative and transferred to formalin is a 1.2 cm brown, bony core; submitted for decalcification.  (1ns) EL

MICROSCOPIC DIAGNOSIS:
1-2. Bone marrow, core biopsy, touch preparation, aspirate smear, and peripheral blood smear: Approximately 40% cellular bone marrow with tarilineage hematopoietic mturation, including abundant megakaryocytes. Please see COMMENT.

COMMENT:
--------
Our assessment of a bone marrow core biopsy cellularity is limited  by marked retraction artifact, which renders assessment of cellularity difficult.
Megakaryocytes are abundant and include occasional clusters. Review of the bone marrow aspirate smear shows a rare megakaryocyte with atypical
(hypolobated) nucleus, but most of the megakaryocytes are cytologically unremarkable. A reticulin stain on the bone marrow core biopsy shows mild reticulin fibrosis that involves areas beyond blood vessels, but without formation of interlacing networks. An iron stain on the bone marrow aspirate smear shows trace storage iron.  Sideroblastic iron is present, but ringed sideroblasts are not identified.

The morphologic features are not entirely specific for the diagnosis of a chronic myeloproliferative disorder. In particular, diagnosis of polycythemia vera requires clinical correlation and correlation with JAK2 mutation status.
In addition, we would recommend hemoglobin electrophoresis to examine the possibility of polycythemia due to a high affinity hemoglobin if clinically indicated.

A 500-cell differential count of the bone marrow aspirate smear reveals:
0.6% blasts, 1.2% progranulocytes, 43% other granulocytic precursors and neutrophils, 25.8% erythroid precursors, 20.4% lymphocytes, 3.6% eosinophils, 0.2% basophils, 4.8% monocytes, and 0.4% plasma cells.

Now, I am left with no answers and nothing wrong.  Although I do not want there to be something wrong, I am very upset that I have no answers.  Is this all stress??? Is this just depression???

                I was wondering how long someone can have Leukemia and go undiagnosed before it is very obvious what is wrong? I am 28 and have had some really crazy symptoms since the birth of my daughter in 2004. It has been a never ending battle of frustration. 3 months after my daughter was born I started having problems with my legs feeling weak and giving out from under me, I lost 20 lbs in 2 weeks, and started to have blurriness in left eye. Then in Feb of 2005, I had to be hospitalized because I couldn't walk or barely talk, and had severe fatigue. They thought I had a stroke because my left eye was droopy. I have been bruising really easily for a few years now and my anemia has not been under control. I have started a new symptom lately that really bothers me because I cannot get comfortable. I have started itching all over despite drenching my self in lotion. I have also noticed my lymph nodes slightly swollen on collar bone, pelvic area, under arm, and in neck. They are not very swollen, about the size of small grapes. I have been told that I possibly have MS or Myasthenia Gravis, but NO Lesions means no diagnosis. I have a new neuro appt on Feb 4th, 4 years after my first initial ""attack"" of whatever is going on with me. I have seen 3 neuro's, one hematologist, and 2 PCP's. I am so frustrated at everything and wish for an answer. My CBC's are always abnormal, but I haven't had one since 4 months ago. I will have to try to find those results. I would appreciate any advice, I can get. I usually post my stuff on the MS forum since that is what 2 doctors have told me I possibly have. I don't want something serious like Leukemia to be what is wrong, I just want to know what is wrong with me and I want to play with my kids without saying "" wait a minute I need a break"" after only 2 min of playing! I would appreciate any advice and if someone thinks this sounds familiar, please let me know.  I forgot to mention that I have horrible heat intolerance and I have been getting heat rash every time I take a shower now. I have also started to lose weight again. I just had my second child in March and I am already back down to 120. I have lost all of my pregnancy weight and then some since then.

I feel great, have no fevers, no night sweats, not tired, I actually run or spin 4-5 times a week, no lumps, nothing...had a physical a month ago, everythng was fine ( lymph at that time were 18 % and absolutes were 1100).

I'm scared to death...any information???

                thanks for you time, Dennis.  I have had my thyroid checked, colonoscopy (sp) endoscopy, upper gi, ultra sounds, MRA scheduled for tomorrow, cortisol (sp) is normal, serotonin is normal. Tested for MS

One thing being considered is carcinoid tumors/syndrome, but again, the blood work doesn't support it. 

I went into congestive heart failure after my 3rd was born (4 days post p) found right aortic insufficiency and mitro valve prolapse, right sided, mild. That + flushing and other symptoms brought on the carcinoid idea.  I am an enigma

                I have been ""unwell"" for a while, but painfully sick and getting worse since September 

Have had many many tests,and nothing. normal cbc.  

I've lost 30 pounds, though I have good days, there are more bad days. drenching night sweats, though not all of the time. almost constant chills, fatigue/weakness so severe, sometimes I can't even talk. Strange flushing  of my face and neck. I suffered horribly with itchy rashes on my legs for months, but those seem to have subsided. 

Just found swollen nodes on neck, GP said get these biopsied within the next week. I had an appt. for  today, but became so sick, like my body shutting down, couldn't move, or speak. It passed, but I could not make appointment and they can't see me until Monday. Additionally, I have this terrible pain from the base of my skull down the back of my neck and into the left shoulder. I also have a dull aching in my liver region. Flu/ confusion/vision/ symptoms are pretty standard. Headaches, and at this time, I can't even bare the thought of food and am losing about a pound a day. 

1) Can I still have cancer with normal blood work?
2) Is this neck pain something to worry about?
3) liver?
4) It is Friday night, should I call my doctor now after todays episode. I literally had to crawl to the door to call my neighbor to my aid. Still, that has passed, and I've been to the er so many times.

still, I also don't want to have a stroke.  

Any thoughts?

                I developed swollen glands and lymph nodes in the normal places such as my neck and back of head, behind the ears. But now I have them all over the left side of my head and on the crown of my head. They are really painful, actually, I feel like the swelling of them is causing pain at the hair follicles. I went to an urgent care because they seem to be getting worse and they had no clue what it could be, but they gave me treatment medicine for a severe sinus infection. Is this the cause of this? Or could it be something serious? No one else has ever heard of it and I can't take the pain much more. What kind of specialist would I see---my primary care physician, a dermatologist, or ear nose and throat doc????

                Hi,
I have had an enlarged lymph gland in my groin area for over 2 years and soft tissue swelling that comes and goes over my left clavicle. i freaked out 2 years ago and had all kinds of tests done, chest xray, abdominal ct, ultrasounds etc.. everything but a biopsy.  at that time i had elevated liver enzymes and had had a transfusion when i was a kid so i had a hep c test and it was reactive. docs figured that explained the lymph node and tissue swelling so they stopped looking. long story short i treated w/ interferon & ribavarin for 48 weeks and just got my 1 year post labs back and no virus. so i'm essentially cured but the gland has not receded and the tissue still swells off and on. my cbc is completely normal, everything in range along with my metabolic panel. so wouldn't something be askew if i had lymphoma or some other type of disease after all this time?  thanks for your help.

I will list mainly the abnormal lab results and from both his October appointment, as well as last week's. That way, one can compare & contrast the two. Thanks ahead of time for any feedback.

I've tried calling him to inform him that they are back and multiplying again....i'm not sure what this is...I feel fine otherwise, but they seem to be persistent...any advice?

                Hello,

I need some advice from another doctor. About three months ago I noticed my daughter had a lump in her neck. It seemed larger than an swollen lympth node, and it is painless. During these three months, I noticed her appetite decreased, and very fatigue. Then, my husband and I agreed that it got a little larger and took her in to the doctor. He said to give it another month and see if the lymph node swelling decreases, if not then come back. We returned to the doctors a month later and he put her on an antibiotic to see if she was fighting some type of infection. He said after the antiobiotic was finished (2 weeks) to return if stayed the same size or got bigger. The lump was still there, and she developed two more around the same area, but not as big. My doctor then suggested to get some blood work done, and chest x-rays. When he feels her lump he said it feels benign to him, but he wants to research it more, and so did we. We decided to do the tests, and the x-rays came back normal. The blood work he said was normal, but showed that she is fighting some type of viral infection, but noting extreme. The doctor also tested her for mono, and that was negative. He left it up to us if we wanted to get in biopsy, or wait a few months to see if the lymph node decreases in size. We felt that was the right move, because cancer in four year olds in very uncommon, and the test results were fine. She still is fatigue, seems pale, but her appetite is coming back. At this point, my husband and I are wonder if we are doing the right thing. Her five year appt. is in May, and the doctor said if it is still there then he might take the next step, which I assumed that meant biopsy. I check her lump once a week, and since the test results a couple of weeks ago, my husband and I think the lump is a little bigger. Again, her lump is painless and moveable. What would you suggest? Thank you for your guidance.

                I have been to Kaiser Permanente several times with no conclusive answers to my symptoms so here is what I consider the main problem, followed by the other seemingly unrelated ailments that I have been experiencing...

For the last 5 months I have experienced sporadic swelling above my left eye.  The first incident was located at the outside corner of my eyebrow.  The swelling comes on quickly and within 30 minutes, there is a hard fluid lump usually an inch to inch and a half in diameter.  After several hours the hard lump begins to disperse and will move down into my eyelids.  The day after the flare-up, the point of origin is sore, but the swelling will usually resolve itself after a day.

The swelling was happening approx. every other week and each time occurred in another location.  The lumps made a slow progression across my face toward my nose.  I had gone about 3-4 weeks with no swelling before the latest incident.  The last swelling started 12/23/2007.  This swelling began on my left temple midday and spread down my cheekbone by the evening of 12/24/2007.  On 12/25/2007, I woke up with a severely swollen eye area – to the point that I could barley open my eye.  The cheek area remained slightly swollen.  This swelling in my eye socket decreased slightly over the period of four days and was evenly only a minor bump under my eye on the morning of the fifth day.  The area around my eye was very painful and when the swelling decreased I was left with a black eye.

Medical History:

I had exercise-induced asthma as a kid but eventually developed the ability to work threw the breathing and when running, I would usually be able to regulate my breathing by the 3rd mile.  The asthma returned after a bad flu in February of 2007 and I have severe bronchial pain in cold weather and around smoke, resulting in coughing fits and difficulty taking deep breaths, ever since then.

I have had an ongoing problem with stomach and bowel discomfort, along with abdominal swelling.  I fluctuate between constipation and diarrhea and have fowl smelling flatulence after eating specific food such as dairy, eggs and bananas.  I experience severe discomfort in association with eating eggs and dairy products but have been repeated refused referral to the allergist to definitely test for allergies to these food items.

After eating foods with soy sauce I have extremely painful swelling in my lower legs.  But again, have not been able to determine which specific food ingredient is causing the allergy.

I also experience numbness in my hands and feet in cooler weather.  I have been repeated tested negative for diabetes (which runs in my family) and have been told I have good arterial pulses.  My fingers and toes turn purple and often white similar to the look of Raynaud’s Disease.  My father has the same problem. 

08/2005: While hiking across Costa Rica, I developed a skin lesion on my left mid-calf.  When first discovered, the lesion was approx. 0.5 in. in diameter.  I was given topical medication, with no avail, and the sore continued to grow to 1.75 in. in diameter at it’s widest.  The sore was red, raw, and dry with a ring of white flaking skin that would peel away as the sore increased in size.  Damp conditions caused accelerate growth.   I experienced radiating shooting pains from the affected area up through my thigh and hip.  My overall calf appeared to be retaining fluid.  I returned to the US and saw a doctor who was unable to diagnose the sore.  I was given antibiotics and a topical anti-fungal medication.  The sore eventually healed, leaving a scarred dent in my calf.  The sore was present for over 2 months before symptoms resolved.

08/2005:  I also contracted an intestinal parasite on two occasions while in Costa Rica.  I was unable to absorb any foods and for a time had trouble keeping down fluids.  I had severe diarrhea and vomiting for one week each time.  I was given a prescription antibiotic both times.

02/2007:  I had the flu and had a fever above 104 degrees for 4 days and 101 degrees for the next three days.  I was unable to keep down fluid until the 5th day and lost over 12 lbs.

06/2007:  On a routine pap smear, I tested positive for Chlamydia and had evidence of bacterial vaginosis.  I was given Azithromycin and my partner was also given the antibiotic dose.  A follow-up test was clear of any STD’s. 

07/2007:  The ball of my left foot, just below my big toe began to hurt when I walked.  After two days of pain, my foot began to swell and I was unable to put pressure on it.  I experience shooting pains radiating up from my toe into my hip.  I was icing and keeping the leg elevated but the swelling continued and I went to the ER on 7/26/2007.  The ER doctor believed that I had gout, although my uric acid levels were low.  He administered two doses of medication but I had no relief.  The swelling eventually went down and I was able to put light pressure on my foot on 7/31/2007.

11/2007:  I had a week of not being able to keep down food, vomiting immediately after ingesting any food.  I experienced no other flu like symptoms.

11/20/2007: I experienced severe bleeding after intercourse and had to use a tampon to control the bleeding.  After 4-5 hours and changing the tampon once, the bleeding stopped.  However, the next day, I began to bleed again while at work.  I scheduled an appointment and was seen that evening.  The doctor said that in the smear she examined under the microscope she noted a high presence of WBC and said that this indicated infection.  She wanted to wait until the test results were back to prescribe an antibiotic.  All test results came back negative and I was not contacted again.

                Hello,

I recently had my adenoids removed (in september) because they were extremely enlarged and were causing all sorts of sinus issues for me and I've had a swollen posterior cervical node for many months (that I keep touching and irritating).

A biopsy was run on them to rule out any lymphomas. I also had a slightly elevated WBC count for a while (neutrophils) and have terrible allergies. Could I be confident that I dont have lymphoma based on the negative biopsy of my adenoids?

                Diagnosed with CLL in Nov 07 following blood tests for somthing else! Feel really fit and healthy but am concerned about blood test results. White cells have gone from 147 to 182, lymphs from 112 to 178 in 4 months. Other bloods near normal - red 4.5, platelets 196, haemoglobin 14.7.
I've got small nodes on my neck - for about 5 years and others in groin, abdomen that showed up on CT scan. Spleen is marginally enlarged but not causing a problem. No other symptoms. I'n ZAP70 and CD38 negative which I am told is a good sign.
If some counts are going up so quickly should that not affect my others? Should I feel as fit and healthy as I do now! (not complaining)
I had flu and a gum/tooth infection about a month before my last test - would this affect the numbers.
I have another test in 2 months and the doc is lookinng to start treatment if the numbers continue to rise. Any advice would be appreciated.

                Scared to tears ...I'm a 50-year-old healthy male that's waiting on the results on my PET scan after a CT scan showed enlarged lymph nodes in my back. My PCP told me not to panic as the PET scan can be used as a test to eliminate things as well as confirm. MY PCP also reminded of a 2.5 month viral illness in 2004 in which I had night sweats, but no fever, loss of appetite, swollen glands, or weight loss. He said that my lymph nodes could have become enlarged at that time 
and never returned to normal size.

Let me back up a few weeks - I had pain in the center of my chest/right shoulder blade and heartburn/belching ... went to a GI surgeon and she ordered a gall bladder ultrasound. After the test, she phoned and said my gallbladder was fine. So onto the CT scan ... after the CT scan, the GI asked the radiologist to call me about the enlarged lymph nodes in my middle back. 

He did and matter-of-factly suggested lyphoma to be the cause and told me not to worry as most people survive lymhomas.  He also referredme to an oncologist whom I saw day before yesterday. The oncologist drew blood and my CBC was totally normal.  He also stated that swollen lymph nodes in the back could be other things besides lyphoma and said that even if it was lyphoma, it was treatable.  I have had none of the typical symptoms that go along with lymphoma, i.e. night sweats, fever, loss of weight, etc.  The oncologist also stated that he did not think I had cancer, but wanted me to continue with the PET scan as well. The oncologist also set me up with a GI who is going to do an endoscopy Tuesday.  I met with the GI who also said that based on my CBC, he would not suspect cancer. 

I really need some encouragement here and have some questions ...

1) How often does one get lyphoma displaying no symptoms at all ? 
2) If it turns out to be lyphoma, can it be treated and how ? 
3) Will be life be normal during and after the treatments ? 
4) Are benign tumors possible in lymph nodes ? 
5) I have continued to belch - could a swollen lymph node be causing that ? 

Any support appreciated and your stories welcome !!

                Hello. About two weeks ago I noticed an enlarged lymph node in the rigt side of the neck. I'm a little worried because my mom died two years ago - shte had a lymphoma. The node is a bit long, which made my GP to think that it's not a lymph node, but a tendon. Anyway, I checked it with a echo and it is a lymph node. The doctor said that it was nothing serious. I made a blood test and the results are:
Leuc. 9,8 G/L
RBC (еритроцити) 4,9 T/L
Hb 148 g/l
Hct 43 %
Plt 318 G/L
CУE 3 mm
MCV 87 fl
MCH 30,2 pg
MCHC 348 g/l 

St 2%, Sg 66%, Ly 30%, Mo 1%, Eo 1%

I had some throat infection about a month ago, but it was only for a day, or two... Should I be worried, having in mind these results?

Thanks in advance!

                I am a 21 year old male and i have had a number of swollen lymph nodes across my body for a long time. I don't know if they count as swollen any more... they don't hurt and never have unless i mess with them, nor do I feel them as an obstruction unless i begin to mess with them. At that point they become more prominent and start to hurt. if i leave them alone they go back to their old level. this is to say that they are under the skin, invisible to the naked eye, but i know where they are and can easily feel them with a finger. I have 2 on either side of the groin, basically parallel to each other. I have one on my back side of my kneck and a tiny one on the lower right. Finally, I have a couple small ones right above my adam's apple. I got all of these checked by a doctor and he said not to worry about it unless they increase in size. I know for a fact ive had all of the above since at least the year 2000. I have had no symptoms of any kind that imply cancer, but i would like to know what the chances are that these could be cancer anyway... can someone survive this long without treatement??  (my doctor was not very specific, kind of dismissed it)

                I need help and I don't know where to turn. I have been ill for the last two months with a moderate fever, night sweats, taken two rounds of antibiotics to rid infection - pain goes away but fever does not, weakness, fatigue, pretty much a constant dull headache, neck pain and occassional swelling that makes my neck stiff, pain in my upper left abdomen that is dull and achy and other times stabbing and even throbbing and bleeding gums when I brush my teeth. Was having chest pains and infection was suspected - but antibiotics must have cleared it?

I have had chest xrays, echo cardiogram, EKG, CT of sinuses, CT of abdomen, three CBC test, bleed time test, enzyme blood tests, and a Von Willebrand test. I have seen a general practitioner, cardiologist and most recently an oncologist/hematologist. The gp doesn't know what to do with me and has actually retired and won't becoming back after the New Year - he just said that my illness is legitimate and he doesn't know what to do for me. At least he is honest. He sent me to the cardiologist. The cardiologist and the gp talked and thought maybe I had leukemia so they sent me to the oncologist/hematologist who said that I don't have leukemia after looking over my chart and tapping me in the back four times. He ordered a Von Willebrand blood test to be sent to the Mayo Clinic - but that was all he tested for. I am 31 years old, four pregnancies - 3 of them delivered alive and 4 surgeries with no bleeding complications. 

My fevers range from 99.8 - 102.9 I have fever blisters on my lips and occassional heat rash. I take Tylenol when it gets above 101 - but I don't want to take too much Tylenol - if that is possible.

I'm told that I don't have mono (2 negative tests), I don't have lyme disease, I don't have CFS, I don't have leukemia. I don't have depression.... etc... I've been sick for 2 months!! What is wrong with me? I am normally healthy and active.

                For that past month or so I have been having a lot of pain in all of my joints - knee's, wrists, fingers, elbows, ankles, etc. I went to the Dr. and he checked me for arthritis, Lupus, etc. and all the tests came out fine.  Then about a week later I started getting these really bad bruises all over my body for no reason. Some of them are/were the size of my wrist. And small ones all over my arms and legs.  
Some other symptoms I have been having are having no energy. I have to drink coffee all through the day to function. And a few months ago I started sweating a lot. Just sweeping the kitchen floor will get me to sweat. Before, I wouldn't even sweat during exercise. Now I get litterally soaked after working out.  But my Dr. took that as I have been working out more and my metabolisim has sped up some, but now they are thinking otherwise.  And when the Dr. felt under my ribs and pushed, it was pretty uncomfortable on the left side right under the ribs, and not tender at all on the right side. He said that it was my spleen that was where he pushed.
He talked to me about leukemia and Hodgkins disease and a few other blood cancers. But the two main ones he was talking about was the two that I mentioned.
One thing that worries him is that we have a history in the family of blood cancers and dissorders.
He didn't really give me any other explanation of what could be wrong with me.  He drew a lot of blood and said we should know more on monday or tuesday. 
This whole thing has gotten me really scared.  
What do these symptoms mean?  Do these symptoms point to cancer? Has anybody gone through something similar?

                Hi, I am 30 year old female who is very healthy, eat right, exercise every day.  Just a day after my menstruation, I noticed two small grape sized nodes under my skin on the right side of my groin.  I didn't think big of it until it didn't go away the next day.  The next day I had one small grape sized node swollen up on the left side.. That was exactly a month ago .  

First, I suspected STD since I did have unprotected sex a week before that starting from a month ago.  I only had intercourse 3 times, all unprotected with a same guy.  So the first thing I did was to get myself tested for STD.  All test results came back negative with Hepatitis C on the borderline.. Don't know what that means but I certainly use no drugs/needles/no blood transfusion..  I visited Obgyn, he did papsmear and urine work. everything was normal.  But when the obgyn pushed down my lymph node when he examined my uterus , the next day, it inflammed really bad and I waited about three more days.  Then I coudln't wait so, I went to see an Internal Medicine doctor.  He after examination , thought it was bacterial vaginosis and perscirbed me Flagyl and yeast pill though I really didn't have burning feeling while urinating..  He said I had severe bacteria infection and he also saw yeast..   I never even take cold pills for flu so I was skeptical at first because I thought my body was strong enough to fight the kind of bacterial infection in my vagina..  but since the swelling has gotten serious and I felt chills and just general ill feeling, I took his advise and took one pill.   Then I took one more pill the next day and stopped about two days.  The swelling didn't go away and by this time the left lymph nodes in my groin also got swollen up pretty bad not as bad as my right groin,I talked to the doctor and we decided to continue taking it as he instructed ( two pills a day until I finish it)    

Upon completing my medication for a week, the left nodes have been healed.  The right sides remain the same although the swelling has considerably gone down.. the sides of the nodes stays the same.. and now it even hurts w/ a little bit of throbbing pain.  It measures about 1 and a half inch to 1 3/4 inch.  It feels like I have small flat rubber under my skin and I just want to take it out of the skin..  
My medical history includes nothing but history of urinary tract infection, discomfort urinating, like scratchy feeling inside my bladder whenever I eat meat/poultry ..  My urine turns cloudy whenever I eat meat/chickens...  and because of that I do not eat meats...However, a week prior to developing the symptom, I did eat ""rare"" steak sold in the food market along with chicken and some other bread puddings and noodles that I thought was spoiled a little but .. I just ate them after heating them..  I was under a great amount of stress at the time /strict diet / exercise schedule everyday... so.. my body was actually a very week..  I developed canker sores (not cold sores .)  about four inside my mouth .. and it didn't go away for three weeks prior to my swollen lymph nodes..  and after eating all those pre-made foods,  I  felt really sick with headache for about 2 days ..  usually a sign when I overeat or eat bunch of different foods in a short amount of time.. 

I also thought of mononucleosis but none of the symptoms applied to me. ( no sore throat, no itchy eyes, no abdominal pain/swollen liver/spleen, etc..)    Then I thought of toxoplasmosis but does that also enlarge the lymph node in the groin ?    Unfortunately, I trusted myself too much and my health, I didn't have insurance .. I will be covered starting January .. but therefore, I was hesitant to go to different doctors..  I already spent well over a grand to different doctors and tests..  

I ran STD test plus about a week and a half later with Internal doctor another ghonnorrhea and chlamydia test ( all came back negative again )..    I just want to know what tests to ask for or what DOCTORS to go to ...in case I visit another doctor before December is over ..    I don't know why the right lymph nodes are not disappearing ... Also, I have lower back pain that usually is associated with menstruation but it disappears about a day but I've been having the lower back pain that began with the lymph nodes that still stays w/ me until now..    and I really can't tell I feel lousy because of the back pain or the lymph node swelling ...  

If anybody can give me any advise, I 'd really appreciate it...    Since I am very sensitive.. and also never been sick.. this whole deal kind of comes to me w/ great shock and I just want some answers...  please help me..

                Thankyou in advance for any advice. 
I'm writing regarding my son who is almost 4 years old. He has had some health issues since birth, was born prematurely, shortly after coming home from the NICU he contracted RSV and ended up spending 6 weeks in the PICU with complications. Came home at 2 months old with chronic lung disease. By 18 months old his respiratory problems were almost completely resolved, but he continued to have lowered immunity and was always on antibiotics for various infections. At 2 1/2 years old he started to have severe eczema and frequent episodes of fever and fatigue. At this time he also developed a very enlarged cervical lymph node under his jaw on the right side of his neck. His doctor ordered blood work, which came back normal. Tests for Mono were negative. We were sent to an ENT who wanted to moniter the growth of the lymph node for one month and then make a decision to biopsy or not. This was last december, 2006. Our health insurance changed january '07 and so did our docters, so we were not able to go back to that ENT. I read that enlarged lymph nodes in children can stay that way for several months, so I decided to wait before I went ahead with further medical testing. Several months later he was unable to catch his breath after running around outside and I brought him into Urgent Care. The docter on call noted the very large lymph node and ordered blood work and a chest xray. Both came back normal. We were referred to another ENT. 
This ENT said he is concerned by the size (golf ball sized) and consistency (quite hard) but didn't seem to believe me that it has now been that way for a full year. He had us make an appointment for an ultrasound, which will be on January 2nd, 2008. 
My question is... WHAT could cause a lymph node to be this enlarged for THIS long in a preschool aged child? Does the fact that it has been this way for a year rule out anything serious? It has never decreased in size, and has gradually increased. 
For the past three weeks he has had a persistent cough and fevers almost every night. We've had a cold going through everyone in our house (we have three other children) but he has been hit the hardest and cannot seem to recover from it.
I have attached two pictures so you can see the size and location. The node goes from right under his right ear to the middle of his throat. I also included a view of the left side (no visible nodes) for comparison.

He also said it feels mushy, which is a good sign. Wouldnt the node be going down by now, if it would be from the tooth infection?

Question!  I had lyphmnodes removed for the mastectomy last Novemeber and analyzed.  They were shiney and clean.  If there were an issue, in my groin or any other location of my lymph system, would that not have been discovered then?

                Hi there,

I have noticed 2 small lumps under my right armpit today.  They are quite small and a little painful, especially when I lift my arm.

I am a 30 year old male who has never had any major health issues before.  I am fit and run about 75km/week (about 46 miles).  They developed overnight after playing cricket (a game requiring a lot of hard throwing with my right arm), which I play every week.

I was in China for work for a week (got back middle of last week) and had a mild stomach upset while there.  I have had a couple of colds this year, not too serious and not for a few months.

Should I be worried?  A friend had similar lumps and was diagnosed with lymphoma and passed away a year later.  If these lumps were indicative of something more serious I would have other symptoms wouldn't I?

I was promptly transfered to a hemotology/oncologist who diagnosed me with AML. He ordered bone marrow biopsy and blood work. Here is my problem. 
1. pathology on the specimens were fixed based on an ovarian cancer and isn't realy very usufal for determining my type of leukeamia
2.  All bone marrow and blood tests have come back completely normal! no sign of leukeamia
My Hem/onc wants to treat me as if I have full blown AML and start induction therapy ASAP. I know this is an extremely rare presentation but is going ahead with chemo without having any markers to go by the correct path?
The tumor on my ovary was first discovered 10/10 by pelvic exam and 10/19 on ultrasound. Is classified as a complex mass which sent me on this jouney.

I went back last week for a follow up after having started taking multivitamins and some iron supplements in the summer. Everything in the red blood count is normal now. WBC is in normal range of 4.2. However the neutrophils is still low 1483 (again normal being 1500-7800) Everything else is as follows:
lymphocytes 2045 (normal 850-3900)
Monocytes 496 (200-950)
Eosinophils 155 (15-500)
Basophils 21 (0-200)

The % breakdown is
neutro 35.3%
lympho 48.7
mono 11.8
eosin 3.7
baso .5

Platlet count is normal at 222 thousand

My doctor wasn't concerned as the WBC count had gone up and is now in range. Does this seem normal?

Although now the acne was gone for a long time, the swollen node still persists. It tends to be soft and doesn’t get any bigger. I also read it from here that the swollen node is very sensitive. So I guess it doesn’t help when I keep checking and touching it. My question is: is it possible that this swollen node occur from the result of small infected acne? & what are your recommendations on this swollen node? I have no other significant symptoms (no fever, no night sweats but occasionally fatigue…not like I can’t get out of bed..it’s like a bit tired sometime)

                My son is going to see a hematologist after he had several labs done that came back abnormal. I dont know what the actual results were, but they did tell me his white count was high, his pt,ptt was high or abnormal and his bleeding time took too long or longer than normal. The reasons for the test to begin with is his tendacy to bruise. At the same time he was sent for lab work he had just been diagnosed with MRSA on was on clyndimicin, couldnt that have affected his white count?? Also whenever my son gets really upset, for instance when he has to gets labs he literally freaks out, it takes about me and 3 lab techs and usually about 30 minutes plus to get his blood. He screams, tightens his body, turns blood red, chokes hiself until he almost throws up and fights with all his strength the whole time, usually one of the techs has to start fanning him. After the blood is finally drawn, (which by the way his blood takes forever to come out every time and he has to be stuck in a lot of places before they finally get it) and his blood red appearance starts to fade he is broke out all over his face ( very badly around his eyes), chest, arms, legs and sometimes other places with what looks like pin sized red marks. It actually looks like someone stuck him with a needle all over. I have read that this may be petechiae. My question is although I realize there may be a serious problem causing the abnormal labs, I also have to wonder if the MRSA or the high amount of stress he is under while labs are being drawn could cause his white count to be high, his pt,ptt,factor 8, etc to come back abnormal?? Is that possible?? By the way he has had recurring MRSA 3 times within the last year. Any help or advice would be greatly appreciated. Tahnk you

I made an appointment to see my doctor next week and Ive been looking online and scaring the **** out of myself with everything online.

They are the size in the diameter of a penny and dime, I am gonna book him in for an appointment with our family doctor, but it takes a while to get him in!

                I am currently afraid of pregnancy (although I haven't had sex)...feel free to read my other posts. I was just changing into a different pair of pants and kinda bumped my left side with my hand. It hurt somewhat, so I felt around and I have a lump! It's kinda tiny; a little bigger than a pea. I think maybe it's a swollen lymph node. It only hurts to touch it and is pretty much on my groin I guess you would say. I had a huge lymph node problem a while ago (went to the doctor saying everything was swollen and nothing was) so it is hard to trust myself now. But those never hurt and this one does. I do not have the same bump on the other side.  Is that a sign of pregnancy? I have just recently started back to school  after a week break for thanksgiving and had to carry by 55 pound bag up and down stairs again, so maybe it's from that. I cannot think of any injury to my left leg though. The only thing I can think of is (sorry) had a pimpleish thing in between my vagina/butt a few days ago but it has now gone down a lot in size and does not hurt anymore. Could the swollen lymph node be from that? I'm already really stressed with everything in my life right now and now with the pregnancy stuff AND now this! I would have never noticed it if I hadn't accidentally touched it because you can't see anything and it doesn't hurt unless I touch it. If I run my hand over it, it's fine. It only hurts to push on it. Please help! I have no idea what it could be!

                Hi,

I am a helathy 29 year old female, working out, never smoked, drink couple glasses of wine weekly.
18 days ago, I found a lump 2cm big, on my left neck. I went to see a doctor, he put me on Amoxycilin 850 mg for 10 day. No change.
I went to see ENT doctor 5 days ago, he did CBC- normal, mono spot - neg.He said to wait 3 weeks and come back to see him.
I admit the forst 14 days, I was touching the lump every 20 min. trying to see whats going on with it. I did not touch it now for 2 days. No change.
About 2 weeks before I discovered it, I had a little gum abscess on right side and felt very tired for about 3 days for no reason.
I am very scared of cancer and it is ruining every day of my life. I can stand the wait if it disappears or not.
What are the chances it is serious? How long does it usually take for the lump to go away if you stop touching it completely?
Can I help it somehow? ( special nutrition, vitamines or sauna?)\
Thank you

Petulka

                I have a low WBC (4.1 with ref 4.8-10.8).  This was being monitored due to a medication.  They switched my medicaiton and it remains low.  They conducted a couple of weeks of tests which also reveal a low RBC of 4.53 (4.70-6.00), a low to 'just in range' HCT going between 38.6-41 (ref. range of 39.0-49.0).

MCV, MCH, MCHC, RDW are well within normal.  Hemoglobin is hovering just above the normal floor.

Platelet counts are normal with the MPV consistently at the normal floor.

Slight Anisocytosis and slight poikilocyte.

Any thoughts/ideas?  Do you think it's the medicine?  I see the hematologist tomorrow and just trying to think of what might come up.

                I had been having pain in my RUQ for about 2 months, went for a physical in June with complete blood work.  Blood work showed mildly elevated liver enzymes.  Was sent for ab u/s which showed fatty liver, spleen upper limits of normal and an area 'of increased density on the kidney'.  The radiologist recommended a ct scan to rule out a mass.  The ct scan was done and was normal except mild fat infiltration of liver,  a large, bulky spleen, that was still within normal limits.  No abnormalities were identified on the kidney.  I still have the pain, which isn't bad, just achy, never have to take anything for it.
On top of all this I have had sinus congestion and a dry cough for over a month.  I had a chest xray which was normal.  I now have tenderness over the left ribs almost feels like a bruise.  I am tired but functioning.  I don't get much sleep at night because of anxiety and nasal congestion.  Other than that I don't have any swollen glands that I can palpate.  I am worried about lymphoma.  My question is would the blood work done in June have shown any abnormalities if this was lymphoma. Can one have lymphoma w/o enlarged nodes?   My Dr. says my blood work does not indicate any blood disease and I shouldn't worry, but is it normal to have a cold for over a month?

I'm not sure this is the right place to post... but I have a question about a lump in teh right side of my neck.. it is right next to my adams apple.. I have to press back a little but can definitely feel it .. the size of a marble or larger.. at least the part I can feel.. I also feel a pulse through it.. Is this my carotid artery, or could it be a lump in front of it.. it is very hard for me to tell .. but there is nothign on the other side of my neck that feels like this (it does not hurt).. its been there for a while.. but seems much easier to find now.. also I have been getting ""chills"" in my jar.. when I am not cold.. it just seems to tense up in my jaw and also all in the back of my neck below the skull . and it causes me to shiver.. I get a pressure in my head as well as more consistent headaches.. I have been experiencing pains in my lower left Abdomen for some time and feel something there as well.. so far nothing has been found.. but the pain at times runs through my groin and down my leg.. obviously i have no way of knowing if this is connected. but feel foolish to run back to the Dr again to look at my neck unless maybe you can tell me you think it is necessary. I have been on the low side of energy and much of the time fatigued for over 8 months now.. had low iron adjusted already and only slightly helped..ANy insight you can give me or direction to look in would be greatly appreciated!! 
Thank you

Anyone have any suggestions to what this might be???

I am not scared about this, as cancer, which is usually the most scary diagnosis is not new to me.  As I said I had a melanoma removed and I lost my sister to cancer a year and a half ago.  Thanks for listening and any insight would be appreciated.

                Hello. 

About 2 weeks ago, I stumbled upon 2 large lumps, about the size of small marbles, to the left of my spine, just on my hairline. They feel fairly fixed to the underlying muscle, they're firm (though not rock-solid), and they themselves aren't tender to touch (though, admittedly, they send some pains through the surrounding muscle). They're not right under the surface of the skin, but are easily palpable (they're huge!). There's no redness, purulent drainage, etc. The lumps are smooth and round. 

Other Hx: 28 y.o. female. Hx Asthma & HTN. No fever/sweats/weight loss. Have had very mild periorbital headache x2 months. WBCs and Platelets ALWAYS slightly elevated (aprox 12.5 and 450, respectively). Returned from Costa Rica about 1.5 months ago. Had ""clean"" MRI in Jan '07 (to r/o MS because of some bizarre fasciculations). Fatigued, but also work 13-hour shifts and work pretty hard. 

Anyhow: My PCP felt the lumps are either lymph nodes or cysts, and referred me to an ENT after a course of Azithromycin and Methylprednisolone x5 days (which shrank the lumps somewhat, but then they came back with a vengeance after I finished the dose-packs). ENT thought cysts and ordered sinus CT to eval headache. 

Fast-forward to today, 1 week after 1st ENT visit: Lumps have grown significantly. CT reveals nothing that might cause the headaches. Radiologist saw lumps and said they appear to be lymph nodes, though added a question mark, as he wasn't entirely sure what they were. To humor me, the ENT is going to remove the lumps in 2 weeks. 

Long story short: I'm terrified. I'm a med/surg RN and see all these patients who originally presented with minor symptoms showing up on my ""doorstep"" later with terminal metastatic cancers. It gets to me. So: 

1) Based on my age, and given that I only have these 2 lumps and no generalized lymphadenopathy, might I be safe to assume that this probably ISN'T malignant? Even though I can't find a cause (i.e. haven't recently been sick)? 

2) How significant is it, really, that these suckers are non-tender and not mobile? Can a cyst be attached to the underlying tissue, or is that pretty much reserved for cancer? 

3) Does the fact that they shrank somewhat in response to steroids/Abx mean it's more or less likely to be cancerous? 

4) Is waiting 2 weeks for an excision/biopsy potentially harmful/wasting precious time? 

Would ask my MDs these questions, but they're either: A) Too unenthusiastic about these things to spend time answering questions, or B) too busy to spend time. 

Any feedback and, if possible, reassurance, would be great. I'm just terrified, fixated on these lumps, and would like to get on with my life. 

Thanks in advance, 

Shannon

                Hi, I'm very worried for my dad.  He's been a very sick man for the last couple of months.  The doctors are starting to zero in on finding out what is causing him to be so sick.  His symptoms are weight loss (25 lbs without trying), feeling of fullness in his upper belly, swollen lymph nodes in his back and neck, chills, weakness and tiredness that won't go away.  The only symptom he doesn't seem to have is a rash and itchness, is this an important symptom that pertains to Lymphoma?

The doctors are saying that if it is Lymphoma than they are positive about the effectiveness of treatment; however, if it is a primary cancer somewhere else and it has spread to Lymph Nodes than they are not so optimistic.  Can anyone shed a light about the rash and itchiness symptom or rather lack of with my dad?

Worried sick about him!
Thanks

                hi
umm i am nearly 15 and i have only lately started to actually notice health concerns and take interest in them.

About 12 weeks ago i found 3 lumps on each side of my groin. i sort of got a bit worried and started to investigate. I then read something about swollen or enlarged lymph nodes. it was then when i remembered i had several lumps in my neck, 1 lump behind each ear and a couple of lumps under my chin which had been there for nearly as long as i can remember (4-5 years maybe). i never told anyone because i spose i was to young and really wasnt aware of these things as much and i basically forgot about them. 2 weeks after i found i had 1 lump under my left arm.

I am quite worried and will probably go and see a doctor shortly. All i am asking for is a bit more info on these lumps. I am also just curious why i have had the lumps in my neck, chin and behind ears for so long and only just recently found lumps in these other places which i am pretty sure were not there before. If you have any info please share.

thans.

                I am a 20 yr old female. In December I noticed that I had two small moveable lumps in my neck. At the same time, I had a pretty decent cold. The lumps have not changed in size, and I can move them freely. I 've had them checked out by doctors and they said it's due to the cold. I have also noticed that on my left elbow I have a small moveable lump there as well, it's on the outside of my elbow. I do a lot of weight lifting so it could be due to that. However I've noticed that every now and then both of my elbows will get a little red and itch somewhat. That is one of the symptoms of lymphoma itching and redness so that concerns me a little. I have no other symptoms such as night sweats, fever, fatigue, sore throat, nothing of that nature. Also, over the summer I have noticed some change in my bowel movements that  they will alternate with soft to regular movements.I've heard that this is also a symptom of lymphoma, so I am a little concerned.  I am a little bit of a worrier so I am hoping that it could just be IBS. 

I would greatly appreciate any feedback.

                Hi.  I recently developed a hard painful lump on the back of my head it is about 1 1/2 inches long and 1 inch wide.  It is rather almond or oval shapped.  It is located on the right side of my head where you have those two equal hard spots (on the left and right).  I went to my dr. and was told it was probably a swollen lymph node due to an infection, more then likely an impacted wisdom tooth was causing it, because when I press on it and it hurts it will also throb at the same time on my top wisdom tooth on the right side of my mouth.  Cancer runs in my family so I am very concerned and not very satisfied with the answer I received.  I have read numerous articles where it says that a swollen lymph node cause by infection are rubbery and moveable.  This is NOT!  He spent around 2 minutes with me and told me to give it 2 weeks.  Can anyone please help me with this so it is not a long and stressful two weeks.  It appeared overnight and has stayed the same size.

what is the likelyhood that this could actually be a bacterial infection as opposed to a viral one?  

Also, I had unprotected heterosexual vaginal sex/sex in general for the first time almost 6 weeks ago, so I am not sure if this could also be a symptom of HIV.  I know tests are the only reliable source, but I am curious to see if this is one of the more common ones.  I do not have swollen lymph nodes anywhere else on my body and have never had a fever higher than 99.6 or so.  Please help me!

user_281447,toyesboy,/posts/Leukemia-and-Lymphoma-/Lymphocytosis/show/308285,Lymphocytosis,"
                I have had persistent lymphocytosis for about 4 yrs. 2 yrs ago hemotologist did extensive blood tests (no bone marrow tests) and determined lymphs are ""polyclonal."" Have had no other symptoms other than a small 1 cm swollen node in neck been there unchanged since 1993. Had physical on 8/7/07 with these results: WBC: 9.8; RBC: 5.20; Hemoglob: 16.0; Hemocrit: 48.1; MCV:93
MCH: 30.7; MCHC:33.2; RDW: 14.0; Platelets: 218; Neutros: 24 (2.4); Lymphs 68 (6.7); Monos: 0.6; Eos: 0.2; Baso: 0.0. (My lymphs and neutros are basically the same for the past 4 years).

At my physical I asked the doctor about splenomegaly. He said that usually he can detect with exam. He indicated he did not. For the past 2 weeks I've felt occasional discomfort and light pain in the left rib cage area and left flank, and my left rib cage appears slightly larger than the right, although no swelling in the abdomen is visible. I am overweight and sometimes when sitting my belly pushes up toward my ribs and it feels as if something is there that should n't be (may just be fat!!). I also was diagnosed 2 years ago with diverticulitis and gastritis (had upper GI and colonoscopy). 

Could swelling in the spleen develop with my level of polyclonal lymphocytosis? Does splenomegaly develop with polyclonal lymphcytosis? Could swelling have developed since my physical on 08/07/07. Or could a recurrance of gastritis or diverticulitis affect this. I do NOT have any sensation of fulness after a snack or a meal. I eat all I want when I want and feel no different than ever.

Sorry for the multiple questions, but the final one is: should I consider making an appointment again with my doctor (whom I saw on 08/07/07), or is it possible I am over reacting?

                Hi Everyone,
My name is Kristin and I'm a 17 year old female. My lymph nodes (where my jaw meets my neck, I believe Submandibular) have been swollen for as long as I can remember, several years at least. I never thought much of this until a little over a month ago, when I noticed new swelling on the underside of my chin (not sure what this one's called). These three swellings are painless. It was then that I began researching lymphoma and registered that there might be a problem. 
Some background: When I was a baby, I got frequent ear infections and had to have tubes implanted in my ears. These were taken out long ago and I haven't had problems with my ears since. I have not had regular medical involvement in my life. My insurance situation is weird and my mom has always had a ""deal with it yourself"" mentality about these things, so I rarely saw a doctor. I last went in the spring (for the first time in years) for irregular periods. My periods had been regular up until about 8 months prior to the appointment. The doctor observed my swollen lymph nodes and suggested bloodwork, but my mom was opposed to that idea. My periods evened out again shortly after, and nothing became of it. 

The size of the nodes in my neck has remained constant the past few years. They're definitely swollen, but the swelling has not fluctuated at all. When I found the new one in my chin, I began to freak out. I just started this month at the University of Michigan, where I get free health service. I went in to the health center a couple days after the semester started to get a brief consultation. The doctor briefly examined me and suggested I see the ear, nose and throat specialist, who is not available until this coming Monday (the 24th). I will see him then, but, unfortunately, I got sick with a nasty cold a few days ago, so I'm afraid he will not be able to target the problem while I'm suffering from an infection that would cause my lymph nodes to swell anyway (even though my nodes were swollen long before the infection). I have been obsessing over this for a while now, and just want answers/to be able to rule out the really scary stuff. If he cannot find the problem due to my sickness, I will probably request bloodwork or a biopsy anyway, just to put my mind at ease.

Meanwhile, I was hoping you could give me your thoughts of my situation. Does it sound like it could be lymphoma? 

I really appreciate any input.

I started looking at my body and i noticed that i had the same looking spots on my chest and 1 on my arm. About maybe 10 total. These have been here for years, as long as i can remember and i am in perfect health. Would petechia from blood disorders come in a form of a rash and not just some dots here and there or would they also come with other symptoms of a blood disorder. Like i said i have had these for years and i cant find that much information about them. Also, they seem to be raised a little bit. If i run my finger over them i can feek them.

I read in your post that your son started to get tiny little red dots all over his body (petechia). Did they look like a rash or was it just some of the dots here and there? Are the dots still there or did they start to fade away or change color? I am just curios about these dots as because i have found about 10 of them on my body but they have been there for years and i never worried about them as i have good health. I am going to a dermotologist on friday to see if they are indeed petechia or just some other angioma which i am hoping for. Your son bruised alot to?

                Hello. I am a 24 year old woman. About 4 months ago I had a pain in the lower right side of my abdomen start with no apparent cause. About 2 weeks later I went to the doctor. He sent me for a Cat-Scan with contrast. All that they could find were the lymphnodes in my pelvic region were swollen and I had a high red blood cell count in my urine. So they told me to come back in three months to have another scan to make sure that the nodes went back to normal. I just had that scan last week. It came back the same. I am still having the pain in my abdomen. All that they have or can tell me is to come back in six months for another scan. What could all of this mean? Could it be lymphoma or something a lot less serious. Thank you, I am up for any ideas.

                Can an ANA positive test (antinuclear antibodies) and a high antithrombin count be a possibility for a blook disorder?

                Just a little history first, here's what I have experienced: 

Diagnosed nearly 20 years ago with IBS 
Had a severe case of food poisoning (salmonella) in 1989 
kidney stones bilateral 
Chronic Constipation 
Diverticulitis 
Gall Bladder removed 2 yrs ago - no stones, just a 0% ejection fraction 
lyme disease in 1998 
Vitamin b12 deficiency 

So...my question for today is, last October I had a CT scan to check for diverticulitis, which was negative.  At that time my Nurse Practioner at the gastroenterologist said that I had a ""cyst"" on my spleen, no big deal, don't worry about it.  In the last 6 months, I have been feeling very tired, short of breath, have been overheating, having night sweats, constant headache, etc.  So I became interested in seeing the CT scan report from last Oct., which says I have a ""hypodense lesion posterior aspect of spleen not seen on previous study measuring 1.4 X 1.3 cm,  clinical correlation is advised"". 

In trying to learn more, which has been frutstrating, one thing that keeps popping up is the possibility of lymphoma, or some other cancer that may be other organs.  One surgeon looked at a scan I had (not this one) and said I had a cyst on my ovary.  I went for an ultrasound and they saw nothing.  

Should I be worried?  Well, that's a moot question, I already am, but should I be aggressively trying to get answers from the doctor???
